A person I very much respect once told me that if you don't publish your writings (in scientific journals or proceedings), you might as well not do research. This notion has become rather popular lately with so many people running their own little blogs. A blog is not the same as a scientific journal or any other peer reviewed publication but a lot better than not writing down stuff at all. And frankly, many blogs probably have better impact than some highly respected scientific journals.

My blog is just a collection of opinions. I read about a lot of technical stuff, science stuff and other stuff and I like to structure my thoughts on these things by writing about them. I like to think my writing makes much sense but if you feel strongly about my opinions or disagree with them, I encourage you to use the comment system. Your comments &amp; feedback are much appreciated.

Regards,

Jilles van Gurp
