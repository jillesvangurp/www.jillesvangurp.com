 Nedstat (a company that has long offered a free site statistics tool) renamed itself to Webstats4U and made a subtle change in their license. As a consequence they may now insult visitors of my website http://www.jillesvangurp.com by displaying advertisements (popups, unders, etc.). While I expect my dear visitors to use a decent browser I can't agree with these terms of use so I have removed the nedstat counter after having used it from 1999.
