[FSM framework](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/publications/FSMCodeExamples.zip). This is a small demo framework for creating and manipulating finite state machines at run-time. The nice thing about it is that I separated control flow (i.e. the structure of states and transitions), data and functionality. It is referenced in one of my first articles which you can find on [publications.jillesvangurp.com](http://publications.jillesvangurp.com).
