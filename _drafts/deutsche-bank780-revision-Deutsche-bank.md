Right now I'm pretty angry with my bank. I'm currently traveling and to my great surprise I couldn't get any cash from any ATM in Boston when I arrived there on Saturday evening. Kind of inconvenient to be without cash if you are traveling. Luckily my credit card works so I managed to get into my hotel and get some food. Also, some colleagues were kind enough to borrow me some money.

Anyway what pissed me off was the following:

On Sunday morning/night (jet lag), I called the phone number listed on my bank card to find out what the hell is going on.

This lands you in the standard useless menu where some very tedious computer voice slowly guides you to your destination repeating every choice you make and asking whether that was really what you wanted. This one was particularly annoying because they insisted on my full account number (they had speech recognition though) and branch number of my local bank office, which is apparently very important in Germany. Naturally, the first questions I got when I finally got a human to talk to me were what my branch and account number were.

Then the misery started, nobody on the other side of the line could do anything useful for me. Lady #1 who luckily spoke English connected me to Lady #2 who didn't and quite rudely told me to go away (in German). So, I had to go through the above mentioned menu again to talk to Guy #1. I then asked him "do you speak English" and he said yes but added "I'm not allowed to speak to customers in English". Eh right. He clearly detected my anger/amazement and then proceeded in English anyway, for which I'm grateful, I guess. He then figured out that I probably wanted to talk to someone in my branch office. So he gave me a number for Lady #3 who of course would not be reachable until Monday. So, I was stuck for another 24 hours without cash on me and I still had no clue why my card was not working (e.g. somebody might have skimmed my card and is emptying my account).

So, I dialed the number this morning and was connected with Guy #2 (without the voice menu this time) who told me Lady #3 was not reachable currently and politely helped by asking for all the details (again) and sending them off to Lady #3 by email with the note that she would call me back.

Finally, Lady #4 called me back because Lady #3 does not work on Mondays and she explained to me the following outrageous thing: this is a 'security feature' that was introduced in September. Whenever you travel abroad, you have to tell your bank and they will temporarily unblock your account for that country. I then remarked that it would have been nice to know this kind of thing in advance. She didn't pick up the sarcasm implied and responded that indeed the message had not gone out to customers, yet (!!!). I then asked if this highly annoying 'feature' could be disabled since I travel a lot and don't want to have to call my bank every time I need to travel. The answer was 'no' you can per country unblock your card for up to a year. You can dial the number on the card to do it by phone though.

So, in retrospect Lady #1 could and should have helped me straight away, which she didn't. I was without a working bank card in a foreign country for 48 hours and my bank has implemented a very customer unfriendly feature without bothering to tell me.

Anyway, if you are stuck with the same bank, you might want to call them before you travel.
