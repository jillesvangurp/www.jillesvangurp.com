I recently left Nokia. Nokia is a great company. They pioneered mobile telephony together with the likes of Ericsson and Motorola and had a huge influence in the market through the last two decades.  Nokia was doing great when I joined in late 2005. Market share was soaring to new highs, cool gadgets were launched every few months.

Then something happened that has been written a lot about. First the iphone launched and roughly a year later Google unleashed Android. I'm not going to rehash that. That's the past of mobile. This article is about the future.

A lot of the rhetoric seems to be about how vendor x is better than vendor y and how platform z totally is going to kick whatever other platform's ass.

Most of that type of discussion misses the point, completely. Creating mobile platforms is a tough business and doing it from scratch is a luxury that few can afford. A successful strategy is using open source. Using open source you can focus your R&amp;D on things that differentiate and share resources with others on stuff that doesn't differentiate.

The battle to make Linux the platform of the future started more than a decade ago. In the late nineties there were several linux desktop and server distributions. Also, several groups were working on embedded and real time versions of linux.  There a few vendors that had linux based products for e.g. networked disks, webcams, etc.

Today, few companies bother to develop a new operating system. Most of the new mobile platforms are linux based, or at least unix based (IOS, RIM's QNX). These platforms break down in two groups: linux based platforms and legacy misc unix kernel based platforms. Already the market is dominated by the former. Android owns upwards of 50% of the market. Add to that platforms like Bada, Jolla, Ubuntu, that share the kernel and much of the development tooling and it's quite clear where things are going. In short, I don't see why any company would choose to make prolonged, multi billion dollar investments in any OS that is not Linux. It seems to me to be a losing value proposition. Even keeping up with the current pace of Linux R&amp;D is probably out of range for all but the world's largest corporations (Apple and MS, mainly).

Corporate inertia and stupidity will likely cause some of these companies to ignore my advice for a while. But inevitably they'll figure it out eventually.

So the future is going to be Linux based. What about the rest? Currently the market is dominated by hardware vendors selling devices to people. These devices come with nice little walled gardens. As these devices become cheaper, they'll become more disposable as well. Inevitably, most people will own multiple devices. That's interesting for two reasons: 1) companies love selling more than one thing to people. 2) chances are that most people will own stuff from multiple vendors.

From a usability point of view, owning multiple devices is not fun today. They don't play nice together and they all compete for your attention. The future trend here is going to be disruptive: this has to change.

Already the first signs are there. I generally have email flowing into devices minutes after turning them on. Like so many users, I use cloud based services like gmail. My profile and settings increasingly reside outside any particular devices I own and tend to survive as I replace those devices.

Imagine the following scenario. You plan a trip at home. You board a train to the airport, sit in a plane for a few hours, and then rent a car to drive to your hotel. During your journey you interact with many connected devices. Your car has a connected navigation system. The train contains connected information screens, just like the airport. Your hotel has a connected tv. If only those devices could get to your presence and personalize their experience. There is no technical reason why they shouldn't and my prediction is that this will happen and is already happening.

The result is a multi modal experience where we are surrounded by connected devices, some of which we own, some of which we don't. This experience is pervasive and it is fueled by technology. Most of this stuff will be specialized. Why would you take photos with your toaster, answer phone calls with your TV, or read email on a screen that is 5x10cm? I'm exaggerating of course. But the only reason we have smart phones is because other devices are too dumb. So today you have one device that doesn't really excel at anything: lousy photos, crap audio, no keyboard, fiddly displays, craptastic software that is ever out of date. That's the price you pay for getting a personalized little bit of everything today. You won't tomorrow.

Multi modal should be smart. You watch video on the best screen available. It streams to that screen via the best connection available (hint: not your LTE smart phone mostly). If your TV has a webcam and a microphone, why would you answer calls by holding a slab of plastic to your ear when you are near it?

The business traveler of the future should have to carry no devices at all. If devices are everywhere, all you need to do is sit down and use them. There is no need to carry them from A to B most of the time. All it takes is clever software that adapts to your context.

Now back to reality. There are several vendors investing hugely in mobile platforms, the cloud, maps, hardware, and loads other stuff. These companies together own all the mobile platforms (Apple, Google, Microsoft/Nokia) and form a oligarchy of coopetitors with each other and a wide ecosystem of hardware, consumer electronics, and media corporations. They share technology (through OSS, standards, and through patent licensing deals). They depend on each other for critical parts of their respective products and experiences. They imitate each other. And none of them will own the entire future ecosystem.

The collective experience offered by these vendors is crap. There
