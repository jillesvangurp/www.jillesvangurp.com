[2084 - Dodging a Dystopian Future](https://medium.com/@jillesvangurp_30276/2084-ecbf9c9fd973#.kg2jvqwz6)

Some thoughts on surveillance technology, the broader impact on society, and my attempt to predict the future. I wrote this up over the past few months and finally decided to click publish a few days ago. 

Posted on medium. So, please go there and do the usual sharing, liking, commenting, etc. there if you feel like it.
