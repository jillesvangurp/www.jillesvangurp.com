I've reviewed hugin a couple of times already. For those not familiar, it's a graphical frontend for a couple of highly useful command line photographic tools that basically allow you to do what some call computational photography, which is creating new images out of existing ones by transforming, blending, matching them in all sorts of interesting ways. One application is so-called high dynamic range photography that combines images with different exposures to create one image with a higher perceived dynamic range and another is stitching overlapping images by detecting identical points, morphing the images such that they line up and making sure they blend in a way that hides exposure differences and stitching + transformation artifacts. The results seem like magic, it just works.

It's all pretty geeky and hard to set up but once installed and setup correctly, there's really not much more to it than to load the images, align them, and click the stitch button. It seems to be more capable than it thinks since I just stitched half a dozen panorama photos from my vacation in the past two weeks. With no exception Hugin indicated a disastrously bad fit and with no exception I was unable to find any big issues with the resulting images. I shot the photos from hand and did not even bother to use a tripod. Instead I try to estimate roughly which axis to rotate around (somewhere center on the line with the lens when seen from above) and try to rotate the camera left to right on this axis. Seems to work well enough.

One of the crazy compositions I did was to do shoot portrait mode in the Colloseum scanning left to right and ending up with 7 images. I did this portrait mode to maximize vertical pixels and fully relied on Hugin to fix any sloppy camera positioning from my side. The result is a huge resolution photo of the internals of the colloseum.
