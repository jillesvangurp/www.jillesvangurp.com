This week I went to a meetup called bot berlin, which is about chat bots. Our CEO @mikkoalasaarela and our chat chief @jennijuvonen were both presenting and there were few other interesting presentations about wit.ai (via skype) and spacy. Wit.ai is the NLP and machine learning based company that Facebook bought to power their Facebook M service. It's also a great tool for banging together chatbots since it can help you translate human entered texts to machine readable intents. Spacy is a Berlin based technology startup that is applying deeplearning to NLP. They have libraries and tools that can pick apart sentences and extract meaning. 

Both of these are very cool technologies and I could see us end up using both. We've already done successful trials with wit.ai and we are very excited about how capable that is and how easy it is to deal with. It's not integrated in our product yet and the main reason for that is that while NLP could be part of the solution of the problem we are trying to solve, it's not the most important part. 

The state of the art of NLP is that it is able to pick apart human language and figure out its syntax (i.e. grammar) using machine learned grammar models and correlate blobs of text semantically through deep learning based on similarity and correlations. Recently, a lot of people have confused this with AI (Artificial Intelligence) since it involves machine learning and neural networks. Somehow people make the leap to what they see in popular science fiction movies. You can't talk about this topic without somebody bringing up skynet. 

Yet it takes more for
