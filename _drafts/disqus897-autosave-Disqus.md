After increased link spam activity (somebody found a way around the captcha) I decided to migrate the commenting system on this site to <a href="http://www.disqus.com">disqus.com</a>. Along with (hopefully) a more spam resistant site, also come some cool features such as Facebook and Twitter login and a few other things. Installation was surprisingly easy. Sign up, install plugin, configure, export comments, done. I should have done this ages ago.
