I had a captcha plugin that was failing. Since I myself hate captcha's, I've removed it for now and adjusted the comment settings to require moderation the first time you comment. Moderation + akismet should take care of most of the spam (hopefully). You can also still sign in using OpenId if you prefer, although the openid login on .

Anyway, happy commenting and thanks @eelkefolmer for pointing out my site was broken.
