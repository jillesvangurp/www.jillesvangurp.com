I've had the nokia N8 for a few weeks now and since I like it, I thought I'd do a little review.

Does out have rough edges? Sadly, yes. But no showstoppers. Its stable. The camera is awesome. I love the latest version of nokia maps and most importantly there's a growing selection of installable apps in the ovi store. All this is good news and it shows in my view that nokia's recent focus on the end-user experience is starting to pay off.
I'm particularly happy with how maps is improving with each version. 

It went from something that barely worked a few years ago to being arguably one of the best mobile maps experiences around. It's certainly very competitive when it comes to map quality, navigation, and offline usage.Disclaimer, I work on the backend services for this application :-).

I've used two ovi store applications to write this post. One is called swype and it replaces the touchscreen keyboard with a version that allows you to 'draw' across the keyboard and it figures out the words with great accuracy and speed.

The other is the official wordpress client, which I'm tring for the first time.
