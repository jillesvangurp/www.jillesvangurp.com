Seven years ago, I joined Nokia Research Centre to pick up research again after a few years of working as a software engineer. Since then, I've been working on many different things but all somehow related to location based services. Three and a half years ago I moved to Berlin to continue in what has recently been re-labeled as Nokia's Location &amp; Commerce unit where I continued to work on location based services.

Now the time has come for me to move on and I will leave Nokia at the end of November. Currently, I am considering new opportunities, which has a very lively and interesting start up scene and . I will be taking a short vacation and then decide on the next steps.
