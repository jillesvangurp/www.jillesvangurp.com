Seven years ago, I joined Nokia Research Center in Helsinki, Finland to pick up my research career again after a few years of working as a software engineer. Since then, I've been working on many different things but all somehow related to location-based services. Three and a half years ago I moved to Berlin to continue in what has recently been re-labeled as Nokia's Location &amp; Commerce unit where I continued to work on location-based services but this time in a more technical role. I've had loads of fun building some of the core server components in Nokia's places and search products; I've had the pleasure to work with a lot of very smart and talented people with a lot of different backgrounds; and I got to work with all sorts of interesting technologies and server-side infrastructure.

The last seven years were fun, very intense, and I learned a lot. I joined Nokia at the peak of its success and have witnessed the steady erosion of market share and change of the organization over the past few years. I consider myself lucky to have been in Berlin in the past few years where despite the relentless reorganizations elsewhere in Nokia, things have stayed positive and promising. Today's Location &amp; Commerce unit is in a great shape for the future and has some really solid products and services. I'm proud to have been a part of that.

Now the time has come for me to move on and I will leave Nokia at the end of November. I'll still be in Berlin in the next few months, which has a very lively and interesting start up scene, and I will be looking there and in other places for new exciting things for me to work on next.
