Ten years ago, I was a computer science student in Utrecht who was about to leave the Netherlands to live in Groningen. At the time, I had been living for about a year in a very spatious (50m2) attic room on a top location: Domplein, complete with nice view over the square.

A Dutch reporter took some photos from a balloon which gives a nice perspective on how nice this room was. I've highlighted which building was I lived in. The house, a four story monumental building was owned by a lawyer. The bottom floor was an appartment he rented out and he had converted the attic into two student apartments. The front apartment, which was the largest, was mine.
