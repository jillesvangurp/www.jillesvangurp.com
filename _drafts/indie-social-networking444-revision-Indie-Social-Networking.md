I have this <a href="http://www.jillesvangurp.com/my-other-sites/">page</a> elsewhere on this site where I try to keep track of various accounts I have with social networks and other sites.Ã‚Â  I updated it earlier today with some interesting additions. It seems finally decentralized social networking is starting to happen. It's all very low profile now but promising too.

It all started somewhere next week when I noticed that one of my colleagues, John Kemp was now micro blogging via something called <a href="http://identi.ca/frumioj">identi.ca</a>. I noticed this because his status in skype was telling me. Since we share similar interests in things like openid and a few other things, I decided to check it out. I never really bought into this twitter stuff and gave up on updating my facebook status regularly long time ago. But this identi.ca looks rather cool, so I <a href="http://identi.ca/jillesvangurp">signed up</a>.

It's basically twitter minus a lot of features with a few interesting twists:
<ul>
	<li>You can sign in using OpenID</li>
	<li>It's open source. The software identi.ca is based on is called <a href="http://laconi.ca/trac/">laconi.ca</a>.</li>
	<li>It's completely open. It has all the hooks and obvious protocols implemented. For example, I microblog using a identi.ca contact in my jabber client (pidgin). There's RSS and probably some more stuff.</li>
	<li>Your friends info is available as FOAF, thus enabling Google's FOAF search to work with the data there and in other places (like e.g. your wordpress linkdump).</li>
	<li>It's decentralized, you can have laconi.ca friends on different servers. Like email, there is no need for everybody to be on the same server.</li>
	<li>It's written in PHP -&gt; you can probably install it on any decent hosting provider you can now run your own microblog just like you can run your own blog.</li>
</ul>
Of course being low profile, there's only the usual suspects active (i.e. people like me).

A second interesting site I bumped into is <a href="http://whoisi.com/p/4061">whoisi.com</a>. It's basically friendfeed or similar sites with a few interesting twists:
<ul>
	<li>You don't have to sign in.</li>
	<li>In fact you can't and there's no need because whoisi creates a nice account for you on the fly that you can access using the cookie it sets automatically or a url.</li>
	<li>You can follow any person on the web and associate feeds with that person.</li>
	<li>It's run by Christopher Blizzard who works at Mozilla. I'm not sure if he is doing this in his spare time or if this has a bigger Mozilla labs drive behind it. Either way, he's a cool guy with good ideas obviously.</li>
</ul>
Since whoisi didn't know about me, I ended up following myself, which is slightly hedonistic, and added most of the interesting feeds. Including of course my identi.ca feed.
