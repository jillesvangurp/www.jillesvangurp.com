I've had the nokia N8 for a few weeks now and since
Does out have rough edges? Sadly, yes. But no showstoppers. Its stable. The camera is awesome. I love the latest version of nokia maps and most importantly there's a growing selection of installable apps in the ovi store.
I've used two of them to write this post.one is called swype and it replaces the touchscreen keyboard with aversion that allows you to 'draw' across the keyboard and it figures out the words with great accuracy and speed.
The other is the official wordpress client, which I'm tring for the first time.
