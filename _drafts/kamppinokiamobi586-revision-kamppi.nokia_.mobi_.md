I'm rather late with this since it has been more than a month this was news. But better late than never. 

You might recall a little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGNYn8YLlpA">youtube video</a> I posted back in October. As promised, but slightly later than planned, my colleagues back in Helsinki actually <a href="http://pressbulletinboard.nokia.com/2009/03/04/indoor-services-and-mobile-advertising-trial-started-in-kamppi-shopping-center-in-helsinki/">launched</a> (press release) the thing in a place in Helsinki called Kamppi. Kamppi is a shopping mall plus bus station in the center of Helsinki. About 100000 people pass through the building every day. Mostly commuters but also shoppers. There's several floors with shops, restaurants, etc. It's an ideal setting for trialing our system and my colleagues worked hard to get the shops in Kamppi on board.

By launching I mean that we opened <a href="http://kamppi.nokia.mobi">kamppi.nokia.mobi</a>, which is a mobile website, for the public. You can visit this with your desktop browser of course but the website is designed to be used from a mobile phone with a mobile browser. A broad range of browsers from different phone vendors is supported but for best results you need of course the latest and greatest from Nokia. Mobile web development really sucks. It's a thousand times worse than trying to support netscape 3, 4 and IE 4-6 at the same time (not so long ago that this was needed). It's a big mess out there of crappy old browsers that crash, have rendering bugs, and interpret established standards in a extremely liberal way. 

You can actually use the website from anywhere in the world though admittedly it is a bit pointless to do so unless you are planning to visit Kamppi or are actually in Kamppi (or on your way to Kamppi).

The site we launched has actually less features then the stuff we demoed in October. The reason for this was a change in focus of the trial and not the technology. The trial is now focused on indoor maps, vouchers, shop pages, and ratings. We found that the other features we demoed in October were nice but also a bit confusing to users. They may be added back later on. But since I no longer work in Helsinki, it isn't up to me. But I put a lot of work in getting this trial going. I helped build and design the software and many of the features and had lots of fun learning Python, Django, and a load of other stuff as well as re-acquainting myself with Apache Lucene, Java, and OSGI.

Some highlights of features I worked on:
