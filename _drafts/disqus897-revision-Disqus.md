After increased link spam activity I decided to migrate the commenting system on this site to disqus.com. Along with (hopefully) a more spam resistant site, also come some cool features such as Facebook and Twitter login and a few other things. Installation was surprisingly easy. Sign up, install plugin, configure, export comments, done. I should have done this ages ago.
