I finally found some time to upload some photos.

I went to <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/11%20Berlin/index.html">Berlin in November</a> to apply for the job I now have. Then I spent Christmas in France. After that, I moved into a <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2009/01%20Habersaathstrasse%2024/index.html">temporary flat in Berlin</a> on February 1st. On my first visit back in Finland, I visited a friend in Espoo who lives close to the sea, which was <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2009/02%20Espoo/index.html">frozen</a>. Finally I took some <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2009/03%20Berlin%20Winter/index.html">nice photos of Berlin</a> in my first few weeks here.

The nicest of which is the view I had from my temporary flat:

I no longer live there and photos of my new place are coming soon. I probably will take a few at my upcoming house warming party: Friday 17th from 21:00, feel free to drop by if you are near.
