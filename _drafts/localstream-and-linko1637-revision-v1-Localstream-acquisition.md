In the summer 2012 me and my friend Mark left Nokia to start our own company. After a bit of brainstorming over names we decided to pass on such gems as Surround.ly, Catchmint.com, and a few others and instead went for an Armenian domain: Localstre.am. Localstream is what has occupied 100% of my time until about November last year. At that point something happened and I've been sitting on my hands not blogging about it ever since. But today we can finally announce to the world that Localstre.am becomes part of Linko.

Linko is a CRM company with a very bold vision to liberate sales people from bureaucracy and an even bolder underlying vision to just automate the hell out of everything that makes enterprise software tedious, boring, and counter productive. This solves some big problems for modern day sales representatives (i.e. anyone that deals with customers for a living) and location is a big part of this vision. Sales people operate in specific areas and they want and need to know about stuff in their area but nobody is providing them with that intelligence. Additionally, the people managing sales team want to break down things geographically to answer simple questions about who is selling what where to whom that are surprisingly hard to answer using state of the are contemporary CRM systems.

Linko in a nutshell is about tapping into your work related mobile phone activity (calls, texts, email, dropbox, calendar, ....) and annotating that with whatever metadata we can get our hands on. This largely removes the need to enter this data manually, which is a vast improvement over the state of the art in CRM software which requires you to enter all of that manually even though that information is readily available on the tool of choice for people around the globe: their phone. Linko gathers this information and solves that problem. 

Now bearing in mind that most of the information Linko gathers anyway can be trivially annotated with GPS coordinates these days, it becomes pretty clear that there is a big role for some serious GEO technology. And that's where we fit in. Localstream adds the where dimension to the who, what, when, and why dimensions.
