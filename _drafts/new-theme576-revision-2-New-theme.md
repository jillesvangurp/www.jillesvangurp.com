After saying good bye to Barthelme I actually considered sticking with the default wordpress theme for a while. Except, it's ugly and not very nice to use either. So, after sorting by popularity, this one on the wordpress theme directory seemed nice enough: http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/fusion.

Also took the opportunity of fixing the page structure (now that I have a jquery powered menu thingy).
