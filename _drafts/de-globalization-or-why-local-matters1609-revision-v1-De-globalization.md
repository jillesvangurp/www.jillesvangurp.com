Over the weekend we built a local news app at the Mediahackday in Berlin. The purpose of this event was to find new ways to utilize the backcatalogs of media companies such as the Guardian, Axel Spring, and others. This usecase is a perfect fit for the Localstream platform that I have been involved with over the past year. So, we went in and did our thing. My colleague Mark MacMahon wrote up a nice article about this on our Tumblr blog.

One of the things that struck me again while focusing on this usecase over the weekend is a phenomenon that has been bouncing around in my head for a while. For lack of a better word, I'd like to call it de-globalization.

Globalization is the result of many of the things that were invented over the course of my (short) life having an effect on society. Thanks to various internet services, we have the world at our finger tips. We can talk with friends or colleagues via services like Skype, connect and collaborate with people anywhere on the world, find out about major news stories as they happen, and share things that matter to us with anyone on the planet, etc. Globalization also has its opponents and critics. Many people are unhappy about how big foreign multinationals are able to act much like nation states used to. Ironically, the same things that have enabled globalization are also enabling the anti-globalization movement to become a thing.

De-globalization is not about that movement. Rather it is something new and much more dramatic. Where globalization allowed people in different places across the world to connect, it did very little to change the way in which people connect with their neighbors, fellow city inhabitants, colleagues, and the local economy in general. While people tend to shop online and use services like Facebook or Linkedin to connect with each other, there are still large parts of the economy that are operating in a pre-internet way.

I was struck about how the old and the new economy connect by an advertisement I spotted in the subway while traveling to the Mediahackday venue.

Alexa is a local shopping mall and apparently they thought it a good investment to spend money on the development of a mobile application for the people in the mall. Then to tell these people about the existence of this application, they invested in a (presumably) expensive advertising campaign as well. This is an offline advertisement advertising the existence of a mobile app that is only interesting if you physically go to this specific mall.
