10 years of commenting on slashdot finally paid off! 

Sadly, the site is not what it used to be. It seems to be mostly reposting stuff I already read elsewhere. It used to be the case that they actually had the news when it was still hot. Part of the attraction always was their rapid response time to news events. That seems to have completely gone. I read about steve jobs liver transplant a full day ahead of the slashdot post.

I used to be a pretty regular commenter there. Now I tend to comment less and less.
