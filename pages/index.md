This is my website. I've had it in various forms since the mid nineties and with this domain for two decades now. For the last decade or so, I've been based in Berlin, Germany and have also lived in Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands (my home country).

## Consulting Services

I am self employed and in recent years I've worked as a very hands on CTO of several companies and lately for [Formation](https://tryformation.com). As Formation is currently bootstrapping, we are also looking to consult for customers on geospatial services. Checkout our services via the [Formation Consulting Page](https://tryformation.com/consulting/). I also consult on other topics outside of Formation. 

I can do several things for you:

- Help you scale your IOT or geospatial architecture. I've been building and scaling backend software for most of this century and have been building geo spatial software for most of that time.
- Help you with your Elasticsearch architecture. I've done several projects in recent years helping customers with complicated upgrades of their Elasticsearch setup, query optimizations, ETL, and more. I have about 15 years of experience with search and have been an early adopter of Elasticsearch.
- Help you with generic Kotlin/Spring Boot projects. I've been working with Java since it was released in 1995. These days I prefer Kotlin. If you are interested in migrating to Kotlin, I can help you get started.

I'm **available** for both short focused projects as well as longer projects. For short projects I prefer to work with concrete goals where I can come in as a specialist and add value. I charge a premium daily rate for my services and typically work in senior backend engineering / CTO type roles. With experience as a startup CTO and principal engineer & researcher, I bring a lot of experience to any team I join.

1. Phone calls are just rude these days. Unless it is an emergency or you know me well: don’t cold call. Especially not during office hours in which case, yes it is inconvenient. See #1.

## Privacy & cookies

This site currently has **no cookies** that need setting, I have no analytics installed, and nor am I interested in invading your privacy. This may change in the future if I add some new functionality to this site. However, current browsers are making tracking quite hard to implement and I actually enjoy using the type of browsers that are good at at this. So, if you enjoy the content, give me a shout out on e.g. Twitter or something. The web hosting that I use may collect some server logs of course. Beyond that, I'm not aware of any kind of tracking or privacy invading tools on this website.

If you are looking for a privacy policy, you just read it.
