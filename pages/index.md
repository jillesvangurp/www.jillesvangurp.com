This is my website. I've had it in various forms since the mid nineties and with this domain for two decades now. For the last decade or so, I've been based in Berlin, Germany and have also lived in Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands (my home country).

## Professional Services

I am self employed and in recent years I've worked as a very hands on CTO and as a freelance consultant applying my skills related to (Elastic)search, Stellar, backend development, and related topics. I also maintain the Kotlin clients for [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client) and [Stellar](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/stellar-kotlin-client).

Currently I do several things:

- I'm active ad as a consultant for several companies. These are typically short projects of a few days or weeks to solve a technical problem, or advice them on architecture, team strategy or product strategy. I usually work with a daily rate + retainer fees. If you need help with e.g. your Elasticsearch setup, talk to me as this is one of the things I specialize in.
- I'm working with a local startup called [Formation](https://tryformation.com) on straightening out their technical roadmap and putting them on a path to profitability. I also do technical work for them.
- When time permits, I work on my OSS projects.

Highlights/buzzwords:

- Elasticsearch and associated tools and technology. I've built and architected many search engines over the years with Lucene, Solr, and the last eight years Elasticsearch. This includes designing ETL pipelines, mass ingesting data, creating sophisticated search experiences, querying, devops, etc. 
- Expert on Kotlin/Java (25 years of experience), Spring/Spring boot, Ktor and many related tools and frameworks.
- Stellar blockchain - I'm not a crypto investor but I have done a fair bit of development work against Stellar in two startups to support various use cases.
- I deal with many different tech stacks on various projects including Go, Scala, Python, Ruby/Jruby, some frontend javascript/typescript, ... while not an expert on all these stacks, I learn quickly.

I'm **available** for both short focused projects as well as longer projects. For short projects I prefer to work with concrete goals where I can come in as a specialist and add value. For longer projects I charge a premium daily rate for my services and typically work in senior backend engineering / CTO type roles. With experience as a startup CTO and principal engineer & researcher, I bring a lot of experience to any team I join.

## Privacy & cookies

This site currently has **no cookies** that need setting, I have no analytics installed, and nor am I interested in invading your privacy. This may change in the future but current browsers are making this quite hard to implement and I enjoy using that the type of browsers that are good at at this. The web hosting that I use may collect some server logs of course; beyond that, I'm not aware of any kind of tracking or privacy invading tools on this website. If you are looking for a privacy policy, you just read it.
