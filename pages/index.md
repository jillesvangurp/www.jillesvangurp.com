I’m an experienced backend software specialist, innovator, technical leader/CTO, and (former) software engineering researcher. In recent years I've worked as a very hands on CTO,  worked as a freelancer applying my skills related to (Elastic)search, Stellar, backend development, and related topics. I also maintain the Kotlin clients for [Stellar](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/stellar-kotlin-client) and [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client).

For the last decade or so, I've been based in Berlin, Germany and have also lived in Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands (my home country).

Highlights/buzzwords:

- Expert on Kotlin/Java (24 years experience), Spring/Spring boot, and many related tools and frameworks.
- Elasticsearch and associated tools and technology. I'm also a proponent of observable software and have architected solutions using the full Elastic stack for logging, auditing, KPIs, metrics, and live insights of what users are doing.
- Stellar blockchain - I'm not a crypto investor but have done a fair bit of development work against Stellar in two startups to support various use cases.
- I deal with many different tech stacks on various projects including Go, Scala, Python, Ruby/Jruby, some frontend javascript/typescript, ... while not an expert on all these stacks, I learn quickly.

Recently I've focused on helping multiple customers with their Elasticsearch setups. I've worked with both small and large companies. I typically come in as a specialist and can get results fast and adapt to whatever technology stack the customer is using.

I'm available for both short focused projects as well as longer projects. For short projects I prefer to work with concrete goals where I can come in as a specialist and add value. For longer projects I charge a premium daily rate for my services and typically work in senior backend engineering / CTO type roles. With experience as a startup CTO and principal engineer & researcher, I bring a lot of experience to any team I join.

A little guide for contacting me:

1. I prefer emails but please don’t add me to mailing-lists.
1. I generally don’t connect to people I don’t know on Linkedin, Skype, Facebook, etc. Don’t take it personally and if I decline your invitation for this reason. See #1.
1. Phone calls are just rude these days. Unless it is an emergency or you know me well: don’t call. Especially if you are a recruiter. And especially not during office hours in which case, yes it is inconvenient. See #1.
