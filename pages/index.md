- Natural team player, with strong interpersonal skills, can build and lead agile teams, coach and mentor individuals at all professional levels and from a wide variety of backgrounds.
- Loves to figure out technical roadmaps and tackle the difficult strategic questions with a focus on pragmatic early releases to achieve long-term strategic value.
- Deep technical expertise and mindset, with hands-on approach to dealing with new domains, tech stacks and paradigms. Using Lucene, Solr, and Elasticsearch for 20 years.

Jilles holds a PhD in Software Engineering from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands (2003) where he also worked as a postdoc, a Swedish Licentiate degree from the Blekinge Institute of Technology (2001), and a master degree from the University of Utrecht 1999.

## Available For

- High-level or hands-on consulting on search architecture, vector search, & elasticsearch/opensearch.
- Trainings and workshops related to that. Want to use Fleet, ELK, or are you looking to level up your search skills? I can help.
- Improving the quality of your search. I built [Rankquest Studio](https://rankquest.jillesvangurp.com) to help my clients benchmark their search quality because I have found that a lot of them were struggling with a lack of a structured approach to evolving their search in a datadriven way.
- Architecture / ETL reviews, workshops, or hands-on deep dives
- Team troubleshooting & interim management & mentoring.
- General consulting on tech, roadmap, or product.

I generally work as a consultant, not as a freelance developer. This means I can work with you in short projects or on a retainer fee basis. While I am very hands-on technically, I'm not able to join teams fulltime.

## Opensource

I maintain several projects on Github that relate to my activities as a consultant and that we use at FORMATION as part of our product platform. Here is a small selection:

- [rankquest-studio](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/rankquest-studio) Rankquest Studio is a web based tool that you can use to benchmark search relevance metrics for your search APIs.  You can try the [latest version here](https://rankquest.jillesvangurp.com).
- [kt-search](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kt-search) Multi platform kotlin client for Elasticsearch & Opensearch with easily extendable Kotlin DSLs for queries, mappings, bulk, and more.
- [querylight](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/querylight) Querylight is an in memory, kotlin multi platform text indexing library that implements tf/idf and a minimal query language. Great for client side search in web apps, android or other Kotlin apps.
- [geogeometry](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/geogeometry) GeoGeometry is a set of algorithms and functions for manipulating geo hashes and geometric shapes with geo coordinates. We use this at FORMATION and this library has served me well in my various startups.
