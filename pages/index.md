This is my website. I've had it in various forms since the mid nineties and with this domain for two decades now. For the last decade or so, I've been based in Berlin, Germany and have also lived in Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands (my home country).

## Professional Services

I am self employed and in recent years I've worked as a very hands on CTO of several companies and lately for [Formation](https://tryformation.com). Additionally, I'm active as a freelance consultant applying my skills related to (Elastic)search, backend development, and related topics as well as geospatial services (through Formation)

Currently I do several things:

- I'm CTO for an early stage startup in Berlin called [Formation](https://tryformation.com). Currently I'm spending most of my time on straightening out their technical stack and roadmap and getting on a path to profitability. Formation is also offering consulting services related to location based systems and we are actively looking for customers.
- I also available as a consultant on other topics. These are typically short projects of a few days or weeks to solve a technical problem, or advice them on architecture, team strategy or product strategy. If you need help with e.g. your Elasticsearch setup, talk to me as this is one of the things I specialize in.
- I am a member of the [The Coder Society](https://codersociety.com) and they've kindly [featured me on their website](https://codersociety.com/blog/videos/the-future-of-libra-and-blockchain-beyond-the-hype) as one of their expert Freelancers.
- When time permits, I work on my OSS projects. Some of my more notable projects include:
  - [The Kotlin client for Elasticsearch](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client). This my third attempt at creating an OSS client for Elasticsearch and I think I nailed it this time. It has a growing amount of users and I put a lot of time in ensuring it keeps up with Elasticsearch releases.
  - [Geogeometry](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/geogeometry) - This library is one of my oldest projects and is what I reach for when I need to do simple geospatial stuff. I've modernized the code base over the years and recently improved things a lot around the time I joined Formation as the CTO.
  - [Kotlin Stellar Client](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/stellar-kotlin-client) - I developed this during my time at Inbot and also made a few contributions to the official Java client at the time.
  - [Ktjsearch](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/ktjsearch) -  this is an offline search engine loosely inspired by Elasticsearch. It's a multiplatform Kotlin project and my intention is to eventually integrate it in this website as well as use it in the Formation Android application (ongoing work).

Highlights/buzzwords:

- Elasticsearch and associated tools and technology. I've built and architected many search engines over the years with Lucene, Solr, and the last eight years Elasticsearch. This includes designing ETL pipelines, mass ingesting data, creating sophisticated search experiences, querying, devops, etc.
- Expert on Kotlin/Java (25 years of experience), Spring/Spring boot, Ktor and many related tools and frameworks.
- Stellar blockchain - I'm not a crypto investor but I have done a fair bit of development work against Stellar in two startups to support various use cases.
- I deal with many different tech stacks on various projects including Go, Scala, Python, Ruby/Jruby, some frontend javascript/typescript, ... while not an expert on all these stacks, I learn quickly.

I'm **available** for both short focused projects as well as longer projects. For short projects I prefer to work with concrete goals where I can come in as a specialist and add value. For longer projects I charge a premium daily rate for my services and typically work in senior backend engineering / CTO type roles. With experience as a startup CTO and principal engineer & researcher, I bring a lot of experience to any team I join.

This site currently has **no cookies** that need setting, I have no analytics installed, and nor am I interested in invading your privacy. This may change in the future if I add some new functionality to this site. However, current browsers are making tracking quite hard to implement and I actually enjoy using the type of browsers that are good at at this. So, if you enjoy the content, give me a shout out on e.g. Twitter or something. The web hosting that I use may collect some server logs of course. Beyond that, I'm not aware of any kind of tracking or privacy invading tools on this website.
