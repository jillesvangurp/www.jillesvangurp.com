This is my website. I've had it in various forms since the mid nineties and with this domain for two decades now. For the last decade or so, I've been based in Berlin, Germany and have also lived in Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands (my home country).

## Professional Services

I am self employed and recent years I've worked as a very hands on CTO, as a freelance consultant applying my skills related to (Elastic)search, Stellar, backend development, and related topics. I also maintain the Kotlin clients for [Stellar](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/stellar-kotlin-client) and [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client).

Highlights/buzzwords:

- Expert on Kotlin/Java (decades of experience), Spring/Spring boot, and many related tools and frameworks.
- Elasticsearch and associated tools and technology. I'm also a proponent of observable software and have architected solutions using the full Elastic stack for logging, auditing, KPIs, metrics, and live insights of what users are doing.
- Stellar blockchain - I'm not a crypto investor but have done a fair bit of development work against Stellar in two startups to support various use cases.
- I deal with many different tech stacks on various projects including Go, Scala, Python, Ruby/Jruby, some frontend javascript/typescript, ... while not an expert on all these stacks, I learn quickly.

Recently I've focused on helping multiple customers with their Elasticsearch setups. I've worked with both small and large companies. I typically come in as a specialist and can get results fast and adapt to whatever technology stack the customer is using.

I'm **available** for both short focused projects as well as longer projects. For short projects I prefer to work with concrete goals where I can come in as a specialist and add value. For longer projects I charge a premium daily rate for my services and typically work in senior backend engineering / CTO type roles. With experience as a startup CTO and principal engineer & researcher, I bring a lot of experience to any team I join.

## Privacy & cookies

This site currently has **no cookies** that need setting, I have no analytics installed, and nor am I interested in invading your privacy. This may change in the future but current browsers are making this quite hard to implement and I enjoy using that the type of browsers that are good at at this. The web hosting that I use may collect some server logs of course; beyond that, I'm not aware of any kind of tracking or privacy invading tools on this website. If you are looking for a privacy policy, you just read it.
