Feel free to **reach out by email** for setting up a short call on how I can help you. I'm available for either short & focused projects or on a part time/retainer basis. I generally start with a discovery project to see how we can help each other where I talk to different stakeholders in your company to get a feel for what is needed.

## Opensource

I maintain several projects on Github that relate to my activities as a consultant and that we use at FORMATION as part of our product platform. Here is a small selection of things I've recently worked on:
