## Available For

- High-level or hands-on consulting on search architecture & Elasticsearch
- Trainings and workshops related to that. Want to use Fleet, ELK, or are you looking to level up your search skills? I can help.
- Improving the quality of your search. I built [Rankquest Studio](https://rankquest.jillesvangurp.com) to help my clients benchmark their search quality because I have found that a lot of them were struggling with a lack of a structured approach to evolving their search in a datadriven way.
- Architecture / ETL reviews, workshops, or hands-on deep dives
- Team troubleshooting & interim management & mentoring.
- General consulting on tech, roadmap, or product.

I generally work as a consultant, not as a freelance developer. This means I can work with you in short projects or on a retainer fee basis. But I'm not able to join teams fulltime.

## Opensource
