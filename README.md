Source code & markdown for generating my [website](https://www.jillesvangurp.com). I use pandoc and a bit of bash to generate the site.

Feel free to copy and adapt as you need. This bunch of scripts that I have is deliberately kept minimal and simple. Yet, I'm of course looking to add features.

The scripts are MIT licensed. The Markdown & website content is not and the copyright belongs to me. This means normal copyright law applies to that (i.e. don't republish without my permission).

```bash
brew install pandoc tdewolff/tap/minify
```
