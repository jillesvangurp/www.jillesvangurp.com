	  <h2><font face=Arial><b>Abstract</b> </font></h2>
	  <p ><i>Reuse of software assets has been, and continues to be the holy grail 
		of software engineering. In this thesis we argue that a prerequisite for 
		reusability is variability. In order to reuse a piece of software, it 
		needs to be adapted to the environment in which it will be reused. With 
		the arrival of object oriented frameworks and software product lines, 
		variability and the associated variability techniques are becoming more 
		and more important. In this thesis, four papers are included that all, 
		in some way, are related to variability. In the introduction we discuss 
		object oriented frameworks and software product lines; we introduce a 
		conceptual model for reasoning about variability; we take a closer look 
		at so called late variability and examine the consequences of variability 
		for the development process of software product lines and software product 
		line based applications.</i></p>
