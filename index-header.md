I used to have a wordpress blog and before that, I used something called pivot. These days I use a simple static site generator (pandoc) with some home grown scripts and templates. I tried to preserve the articles and link structure when I migrated the content to markdown. There is about 2 decades worth of content here. Most of it no longer relevant of course. But I decided to preserve it.

In recent years, I've published articles on platforms like [medium](https://medium.com/@jillesvangurp_30276) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/jillesvangurp) and I've also added most of that content here. I'll likely continue to add more articles. Part of my reasons to migrate to a static website was so I can start adding content again.

Note: I tried to clean up the migrated content but wordpress evolved quite a bit over the past 20+ years. So there are utf-8 encoding errors that may have slipped in, broken links to websites that no longer exist, bits of information that are no longer relevant/outdated/wrong, etc. If you notice something fixable, let me know. Otherwise enjoy.
