I've uploaded some photos I took two weeks ago in [Baltimore and Washington](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-09%20Baltimore/index.html). Also I've regenerated all photos for 2006 in a slightly larger format and added a few panorama photos (all created using Hugin, which I reviewed last week).Ã‚Â  I've added panorama's to older sets [here](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-03%20Winter%20through%20S80/index.html), [here ](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-07%20France%20and%20Italy/02%20Avignon%20Arles%20Nimes%20Beaucaire/index.html)and [here](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-07%20France%20and%20Italy/04%20Cremona%20Milan%20Parma/index.html).
