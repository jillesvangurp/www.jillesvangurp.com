I had a nice article accepted at the upcoming [1st IEEE International Peer-to-Peer for Handheld Devices Workshop](http://cms.comsoc.org/CCNC_2008/Content/Home/Call_for_Papers_/P2P_HD_Workshop.html) at the [CCNC '08](http://www.ieee-ccnc.org/) conference in Las Vegas.

> This paper presents our approach for building an internet based middleware platform for smart spaces as well as a number of services and applications that we have developed on top of it. We outline the architecture for the smart space middleware and discuss several applications and services that we have so far realized with this middleware. The presented material highlights key concepts in our middleware vision: services are HTTP based and restful; applications are accessed through a browser so that they are available on a wide variety of devices; and we demonstrate the concept of bridging non internet enabled smart space devices to our IP and HTTP centric smart space network.
