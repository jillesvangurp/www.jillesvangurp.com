While doing my shopping today I encountered a whole pile of six packs of "[Royal Dutch](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/royal-dutch-post-horn/39691/)". On closer  inspection of this beer that I never heard of, I learned that it is actually brewed in license of Posthorn, a brewery based in my home town (if there is [such a thing](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/about-me/)), of Breda. WTF! I have never heard of this brewery and I was born in the damn place. Googling for Posthorn, or post hoorn as it would no doubt be spelled in dutch I was not able to bring up much more than [this](http://www.deposthoorn.net/). A pretty sad party center on the Haagweg. Note the rather generic, [mirrored logo](http://www.ratebeer.com/beerimages/39691.jpg) on the can here. 

Knowing something of Breda beer history, this is probably what is left of the Oranjeboom beer that until a few years ago was brewed in Breda. Basically interbev liquidated (pun intended) the whole brand and closed down the brewery in Breda. I have no idea what the Royal qualification in Royal Dutch refers to. I don't imagine our [water managing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem-Alexander,_Prince_of_Orange) crown prince [Willem-Alexander of Orange](http://www.latenightpool.net/imgpool/wimalex.jpg) (aka. prince beer) had anything to do with this.

Of course Post Horn duely added water to meet the Finnish super market beer upper limit for alcohol of 4.7%. I must say, it tastes better than the average finnish beer. Similar to Becks if I'd have to pick something similar. I've tried several different Finnish brands in the nearly two years I've spent here and basically have decided that any non Finnish beer is probably better than any Finnish beer. I've sampled some pretty obscure foreign brands, even from my own home country, and they all taste better than boring Olvi, Karhu, Lapin Kulta or Koff. Especially the supermarket varieties of those are filthy stuff.

This Royal Dutch, is the second brand of fictional dutch beers I've encountered in the supermarkets here. The other one is labeled "Amsterdam", which is apparently not worthy of the Grolsch brand of the beer company that produces it. Grolsch actually is pretty nice and I've even encountered a Finnish 4.7% export version of it in some supermarkets. Complete with the obligatory "beugel" bottle. Amsterdam is a pale shadow of this and indeed not worthy of the brand.
