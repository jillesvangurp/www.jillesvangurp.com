I did some maintenance on my website this morning. I fixed a few broken urls to websites of friends. Also I added a workshop paper to my publications that I co-authored with Ronald Bos nearly two years ago. Then I discovered that several of the papers there had incomplete references, so I fixed that too.

Finally, I updated my photo site and added pictures I took last [Christmas in France](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-14%20Christmas%20in%20France/index.html) and [last week](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2007/2007-01%20-%20Family%20here/index.html) when my father, uncle, nephew, and niece's boyfriend visited Helsinki.
