I've been playing around with wordpress for about an hour. Easy to use, feature rich and I managed to migrate my old pivot posts by importing the RSS.

Why migrate away from pivot? Well, I wanted to try something new. Referrer and comment spam has caused me to cripple pivot and frankly, I never really liked the plain text files, the messy templates and the lack of updates during the half year I used it.

Wordpress seems to be popular amongst the 'hard core' bloggers and I like the look and feel. Also the default template is much nicer IMHO.

As for that, I am unlikely to change it much due to a lack of time and interest. That may sound a little unlike me but I am sort of bored with trying to make html+css+javascript do things it is clearly not very well suited for.

I simply no longer believe in this technology: it is primitive, awfully limited and hopelessly flawed by design. Most nice page layouts consist of elaborate workarounds for browser limitations, browser incompatibilities, ambiguous standards interpretations and plain parser bugs. The implementation of the more relevant CSS features are almost without exception problematic.

I have no wish to learn much more than I already know about yesterdays mistakes at Netscape and Microsoft. Every attempt at building something nice over the past few years has ended with me discovering it wouldn't work in IE (position:fixed) or it wasn't possible at all (vertical spacing, css columns with a row beneath) or it would sort of half work in version x and break down in version y of Firefox (never bothered to find out which version was behaving 'incorrectly').
