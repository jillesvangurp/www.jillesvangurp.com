I just installed [Flock - The Social Web Browser](http://www.flock.com/). Right now I'm trying out the blog editor included with it to write this little review. To cut the review short, I'm planning uninstalling it after publishing this post.

Lets just start by saying that this feels like a nice bunch of concepts and potentially useful Firefox extensions but not as a drop in Firefox replacement. Besides, the default theme feels rather amateurish and I already miss my dozen Firefox extensions. And while I am pleased that it supports Facebook, I find the lack of support for much else a bit disappointing. For example, I'm also on Linked in; phib; claimid. I have several openid logins; I use several Google services, including reader, gmail and calendar. All of these are unsupported by the self proclaimed social web browser. Hell, it doesn't even integrate webmail from e.g. google, yahoo or microsoft (I have accounts with all three). You can find an overview of social networking sites I use on my blog: [https://www.jillesvangurp.com/blog/](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/blog). Most of the stuff there is unsupported by Flock.

An exception seems del.icio.us. However, the extension functionality I get in Firefox is much better than the bundled del.icio.us support in Flock which is rather useless. Similarly, the blog editor is nice but nothing I can't get using several Firefox extensions. I suppose the facebook sidebar is nice, but again there is also a firefox extension for that. 

A rather novel feature seems to be the media bar. However, in its current incarnation it is limited to harvesting media from just a handful of popular sites like facebook (again), youtube and flickr. That's nice but not all that useful to me.

So overall I have a bit mixed feelings. On one hand, this feels like a polished product, on the other hand there's not much that I can't get installing a few Firefox extensions. With Firefox 3 around the corner, I'm not planning to use Flock 1.0 based on the old Firefox without most of the extensions I can't do without. Nevertheless, there's some good ideas that I would like to see adopted in the form of Firefox extensions.
