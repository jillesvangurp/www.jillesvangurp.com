 I've long avoided the use of an actual php based blog tool. However pivot makes it really easy to do what I want and I plan to not touch any of the php stuff so I installed it. It's a pretty nice cms / blog tool. It seems to have everything a blog needs like comments, rss feeds, archives, etc. Also it doesn't use a database so it is portable and maintenance free. It's just a bunch of files in a directory. I like it that way. 
I still need to fix lots of things like getting rid of the default layout and putting some content on this page. The frequency of posts won't necessarily increase btw.
