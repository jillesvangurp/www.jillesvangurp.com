 Yep, no more comments on this site. I found my mail box full with so-called comment spam. I don't feel like looking for elaborate half working blocking solutions so I took the easy way out.

Update. Apparently pivot doesn't actually deny access to the comments but merely omits printing the form and the comments. Of course this is not enough to stop comment spammers. Hopefully setting the maximum allowable hrefs is. If not, I'll have to edit the php script myself.

Update2. Nope, I've edited the script now to always reject any attempt to post.
