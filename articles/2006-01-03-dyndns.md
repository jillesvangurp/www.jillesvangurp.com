Since moving to Finland I have a dynamic ip address. In NL I had a nice static address which had its own domain name: jilles.xs4all.nl. Useful for running servers such as ftp and ssh. With a dynamic ip that's still possible but you have to keep track of the ip address somehow.

Or you can use [dyndns](http://www.dyndns.com/). Dyndns offers a nice dynamic dns service, for free. So now my pc is reachable as jillesvangurp.mine.nu. They also have a nice [tool](http://www.download.com/DynDNS-Updater/3000-2381_4-10457726.html) that updates the ip address whenever it changes, also free. I like free goodies and these certainly work very nice :-).

Now I just have to reconfigure my ssh server to use port 443 (ssl) so I can reach it from work (proxy blocks port 22 :-().
