[![My old web site](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/oldwebsite.png)](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/oldwebsite.png)

I just made a few changes that effectively retires the static portion of my website. For several years I had a nice, funky, handcrafted, css styled bit of html living at www.jillesvangurp.com and publications.jillesvangurp.com. The design has been more or less the same since 2003 and the content was not evolving much either. Actually, most of the activity on my domain has been on ~~blog.jillesvangurp.com~~ which is powered by wordpress.

So as of now, www.jillesvangurp.com is equivalent to ~~blog.jillesvangurp.com~~. Visiting either will get you to the frontpage of my blog. The relevant portions of the the old www.jillesvangurp.com have been migrated to their own wordpress page. You can find links to these pages in the sidebar. I've taken care to not break links from outside to important parts of my old site (publications).
