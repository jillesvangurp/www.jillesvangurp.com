What is it with Finnish politics and SMS messages? First prime minister Vanhanen [dumps his girlfriend by SMS](http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Off_Beat/0,,2-1225-2107_2038961,00.html) and now a foreign minister [gets fired](http://www.yle.fi/news/id86849.html) over some SMS messages to a stripper.
