 Apparently the pornsites have found my site and are now unleashing their stupid tools on it in order to get their links in my referrer thingy. I've been getting thousands of hits from domains with such words as 'rape' and 'perversion' in them. Presumably this is intended to improve their google rankings. Anyway I don't feel like monitoring referrerstats anyway.

So bye bye referrer thingy.
