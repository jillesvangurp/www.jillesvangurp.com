I've been a pretty happy wordpress user for the past few months. Though I had some issues with blogspammers, the current settings seem to have restored the peace.

This morning I saw that there was a new version of wordpress (2.0) and of course I just had to upgrade :-).

The main purpose of this new releases seems to have been to upgrade the backend userinterface. The (default) theme for the blog itself is mostly unchanged. I'm not sure if I like the new design. There seem to be a few glitches. For example the tabs look awful and there's this vertical line which is just a few pixels to long. And you'd better like blue because it is all over the place. The previous version had a really clean user interface and this looks slightly more messy.

Furthermore the content editor is now a wysiwyg thingy. It seems to work except that it keeps inserting spaces in front of the first letter of a new paragraph. I'm not sure I like it. I'll probably disable it.
