 I received a 9 euro bill for bandwidth usage. A quick look at stats.jillesvangurp.com confirmed that a bunch of assholes has been downloading the frontpage of my site, a lot. As in enough to exceed 11GB. 

Well the worst of those bastards have now been added to my .htaccess file. Hopefully that will put an end to it.

Update. I've also put password protection on the stats page (which was also showing a list of referrers). The kbyte/per day ration has dropped sharply since I added a few of the worst offenders to my .htaccess file. It seems to be working.
