I finally found some time to upload some photos.

I went to [Berlin in November](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/11%20Berlin/index.html) to apply for the job I now have. Then I spent [Christmas in France](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/12%20Christmas/index.html). After that, I moved into a [temporary flat in Berlin](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2009/01%20Habersaathstrasse%2024/index.html) on February 1st. On my first visit back in Finland, I visited a friend in Espoo who lives close to the sea, which was [frozen](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2009/02%20Espoo/index.html). Finally I took some [nice photos of Berlin](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2009/03%20Berlin%20Winter/index.html) in my first few weeks here.

The nicest of which is the view I had from my temporary flat:

I no longer live there and photos of my new place are coming soon. I probably will take a few at my upcoming house warming party: Friday 17th from 21:00, feel free to drop by if you are near.
