A little announcement. After nearly two happy years in Nijmegen at GX Creative Online Development, I am now moving to Helsinki, FI. 

I've recently been offered a nice job at the Nokia Research center. I am going to work at the Software & Applications lab as a research engineer. This 200 people division of Nokia Research is headed by Jan Bosch, who was previously responsible for getting me to Sweden (when he was heading the software engineering research group at the Blekinge Institute of Technology) and to Groningen when we made a transfer to the University in that city. Since a bit more than half a year Jan Bosch is heading the research department at the Nokia Research Center. A few months ago, he drew my attention to a vacant position and after carefully considering my options I said YES!

The final word came in friday and what remains is moving to Finland. If all goes well I will live in Finland the 1st of december.
