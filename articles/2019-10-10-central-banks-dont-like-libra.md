After a lot of hype around blockchains, Libra is a wakeup call.
Everybody is obsessing over what Facebook is planning. But now the
debate is shifting to how central banks, and perhaps others, can use
blockchains.

## Fiat money is in flux. Question is: what's next?

A few months ago, I wrote
[an article](https://dev.to/jillesvangurp/libra-blockchains-and-the-meaning-of-it-all-1clc&sa=D&ust=1590071095182000)] to
analyze Facebook's Libra announcement. In that article, I put the
announcement into context and went on to make a few predictions. The
main prediction was that Libra would trigger a lot of scrutiny but that
it would also speed up the adoption of blockchains by others.

Now a few months in, there indeed has been some backlash against Libra.
US and EU officials have indicated that they don't like Libra and plan
to ban it. How or what that means is not really clear. But at least the
Libra currency seems to be controversial enough for politicians to make
statements about it. The second part of my prediction also seems to be
materializing and it appears that discussions around regulating and
using stable coins in central banks is becoming a topic.

## The backlash against Libra

Several of the Libra launch partners are getting cold feet. Mastercard
and Visa have indicated that they may not join
the [Libra Association](https://libra.org/en-US/association&sa=D&ust=1590071095182000)].
According to
the [Financial
Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6af11092-e5fd-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc&sa=D&ust=1590071095183000)],
Paypal is pulling out as well. None of the partners have actually
committed to much more than being named as a partner. And given the
political controversy and the threat of regulatory involvement, it is
understandable that they do not want to get exposed to that.'

This does not mean that this is game over for Libra. As I argued in my
earlier article, Libra is more than just the Libra coin. It is also an
OSS blockchain platform similar to Ripple, Ethereum, Stellar and other
platforms. It has some technical merit and seems like it improves over
other platforms in terms of scale and safety. Vitalik Buterin, the
development lead for Ethereum, actually called out
the [technical similarity of Libra](https://decrypt.co/8941/buterin-phase-zero-ethereum-2-0&sa=D&ust=1590071095183000)].

Additionally, the Libra Association is an independent legal entity based
in Switzerland with more members than just Facebook. This means that
what Facebook gets exposed to legally and what this entity gets exposed
to are different things. However,
as [Wired notes](https://www.wired.com/story/ties-bind-facebooks-libra/&sa=D&ust=1590071095184000)]
it appears that the remaining association members have lots of
connections to Facebook investors, partners, and former executives.
Additionally, the listed partners have committed little more beyond a
letter of intent so far.

## The Libra Stable Coin

The issue governments appear to be having is mainly with Facebook's
intention to create a new type of stable coin. A stable coin is a coin
that mirrors some existing currency with a stable value. Essentially, it
is an I Owe You
([[IOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU&sa=D&ust=1590071095184000)])
that may be used in place of real money.

Stable coins for Dollars, Euros, Yen, etc. already exist on several
blockchains and are used by fin-tech companies and exchanges. Most of
these companies are under regulatory control in the EU and US.
Additionally, stable coins are also used for inter blockchain value
transfers. For example there are Bitcoin and Eth coins on the Stellar
blockchain that you can swap at the exchanges that issued them for the
real thing.

However, Facebook's Libra stable coin is different in the sense that
they are creating a new coin pegged to a basket of several currencies
(Euros, Dollars, etc.) and other assets instead of just representing a
single currency.

## Libra and Central Banks

To keep the value of Libra stable, somebody would have to act to guard
the stable value of the coin. The Libra Association is intended to play
that role. Guarding the stability of a currency is usually the exclusive
job of central banks. The way this works is that they hold reserves,
control liquidity requirements for banks, set interest rates, and
translate monetary policy into action using those tools. By doing this
they act to keep inflation at a stable level and prevent wild
fluctuations of their currency.

So, the Libra Association would end up being a central bank for Libra.
By holding a reserve and by buying and selling other currencies, they
would be able to control the exchange rate. Additionally this would
include minting and destroying of Libra coins. These are the same kind
of tools a central bank would use, contrary to
the [claims
on the Libra
website](https://libra.org/en-US/about-currency-reserve/%23the_reserve&sa=D&ust=1590071095185000)] about
the Libra Reserve.

This is of course super controversial and it triggered a lot of angry
responses from countries who consider this as violating their
sovereignty and claim the exclusive right to control monetary policy in
their country.

Interestingly, Libra seems to have provoked
some [people at the IMF](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/09/26/from-stablecoins-to-central-bank-digital-currencies/&sa=D&ust=1590071095186000)].
They are recommending central banks to get involved with regulating
blockchain currencies. Additionally, they are recommending central banks
to start issuing their own crypto currencies. This might have happened
without Libra but Facebook probably sped up the thinking on this with
their Libra announcement.

## What's next?

In my opinion, the Libra coin is actually not essential for Facebook's
main goal to inject themselves into the online payments market and tap
into revenue related to that. They could simply do what others are doing
and create multiple stable coins for Dollars, Euros, etc.

This would allow them to compete with payment products like Android
Pay, Apple Pay, Paypal, or Stripe. for doing payments and implement
something similar to WeChat Pay in China. This would make them harder to
block but easier to regulate. It also would make several of the Libra
Association members less eager to be a part of this as this would
compete directly with their own products.'

Any regulatory activity is unlikely to materialize on short notice.
Regulators are constrained by existing laws, existing interpretation of
these laws, and the snail's pace with which new laws are created and
introduced. In the past years, legislators created a complicated reality
where they've issued rulings, engaged with companies that are now
running businesses. While they might like to change their mind, they'd
have to do so in a way that does not contradict what they've ruled
already or they would risk court cases and extended legal battles over
this.

The recent announcement by France and Germany to block Libra (the coin)
seems to lack a concrete plan as to how they plan to do that. It signals
their discontent but does not provide a clear path forward beyond a
vague "we don't like this\. It's enough to give Libra Association
members some second thoughts but not enough to prevent Facebook from
moving forward with Libra.

Given the lukewarm reception of Libra and the fact that the Libra
Association seems to be losing key members, I'm now a little less
optimistic whether they will launch at all. In my view they might end up
deciding that they have enough legal challenges as it is on the privacy
and tax front that pouring more fuel on the flames by also pushing this
through. Even in a weakened form, this may not be worth it. On the other
hand, this represents a big enough opportunity that they might be
willing to push this through and take the risk.

**Update**: Since writing this article, there was some more news
around Libra. Two more payment solutions (Stripe and eBay) also
announced that they
are [leaving the Libra Association membership](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910330/mastercard-stripe-ebay-facebook-libra-association-withdrawal-cryptocurrency&sa=D&ust=1590071095187000)][.
This leaves Libra without most of the payment solutions that initially joined and significantly weakens consortium.
