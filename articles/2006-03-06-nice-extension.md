I used to be able to try out most new extensions. But during the last half year the number has skyrocketed so each time I look there's dozens of new ones. This particular [extension ](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&category=Navigation&id=1942)jumped straight into the top ten of [popular ](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/showlist.php?application=firefox&numpg=10&category=Popular)extensions. And for good reason because Reveal adds a really nice innovative feature. When you hit F2 you get this nice overlay of minature renderings of all tabs you have open. A Firefox session can easily escalate into having 20 or so tabs open. At that point keeping track of all of them becomes hard. This extension brings some light into the darkness.

A nice added gimmick is that you can view the history of individual tabs by hitting insert. Also you can close tabs by middle clicking the miniatures or simply navigate to them by clicking them. Really nice. Easily the best extension I've seen lately.
