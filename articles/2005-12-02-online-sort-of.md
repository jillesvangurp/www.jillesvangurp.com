I started work at Nokia yesterday and I've got a nice laptop and a phone! So I am back online. My new phone number is:
+358-50-4869193

Also I managed to find an apartment in Helsinki. I'm going to live at
Mechelininkatu 18 A 26
00100 Helsinki, Finland

The apartment is still empty of course but I have the keys and a sleeping bag so I'll have to camp there until the 12th (then my stuff arrives).
