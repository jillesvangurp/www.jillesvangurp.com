I've been using my camera and photoshop a bit the past few months and finally found the time to let jalbum do its job. I've added three directories to my photo album:

- [Some pictures I took on my way to work when it was very cold a few months ago](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2007/2007-02%20-%20Winter/index.html)
- [Playing tourist in Amsterdam](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2007/2007-04%20-%20Amsterdam/index.html)
- [Nice view on the lake and mountains near Zurich](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2007/2007-03%20-%20Zurich/index.html)
