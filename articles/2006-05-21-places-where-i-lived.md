I wasted some time in Google earth creating some placemarks of all the places I ever lived: [Places where I lived](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/places%20where%20I%20lived.kmz)

Just click on it and it should open up the locations in google earth. You need to have Google earth installed of  course.
