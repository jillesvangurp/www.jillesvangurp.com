After saying good bye to [Barthelme ](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/barthelme)I actually considered sticking with the default wordpress theme for a while. Except, it's ugly and not very nice to use either. So, after sorting by popularity, [this one](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/fusion) on the wordpress theme directory seemed nice enough. It's called the Fusion theme and seems pleasant enough and at first glance comes with a couple of nice features. So sticking with this for a while.

I also took the opportunity of fixing the page structure (now that I have a jquery powered menu thingy).
