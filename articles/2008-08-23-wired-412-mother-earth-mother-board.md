Intriguing phrase (about Alexandria's lighthous) from an [article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/ffglass.html?topic=&topic_set=) (page 31) by Neal Stephenson from 1996:
> The collapse of the lighthouse must have been astonishing, like watching the World Trade Center fall over. But it took only a few seconds, and if you were looking the other way when it happened, you might have missed it entirely - you'd see nothing but blue breakers rolling in from the Mediterranean, hiding a field of ruins, quickly forgotten.
