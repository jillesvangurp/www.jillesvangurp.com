I'm traveling a lot lately. Two weeks ago I was in Zurich at the first Internet of Things Conference. I uploaded [some pictures](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/03%20Dagstuhl%20Seminar%20on%20OSS%20and%20SPLs/index.html) already last week and some more today.

Last week I also attended a Dagstuhl seminar on [Combining the advantages of product lines and open source](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=08142) to present the [position paper](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/2008/03/16/from-spls-to-open-compositional-platforms/) I posted some time ago. [Naturally, I also took some pictures there](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/03%20Dagstuhl%20Seminar%20on%20OSS%20and%20SPLs/index.html).

Interestingly, one of the participants was Daniel German who does a lot of interesting things including publishing good articles on software evolution and working on a source forge project called panotools that happens to power most of what makes Hugin cool. Hugin is of course the tool I have been using for some time now to stitch together photos into very nice panoramas. I felt envious and lucky at the same time watching him take photos. Envious of his nice Canon 40D with very cool fish eye lens and lucky because his photo bag was huge and probably quite heavy considering the fact that he had two more lenses in there.

The whole gang together. Daniel is the guy in the orange shirt.

One of the best features of Dagstuhl: 1 beer = Ã¢â€šÂ¬1. Not quite free beer but close enough. And afterall, OSS is about free speech and cheap beer definitely loosens the tongues.
