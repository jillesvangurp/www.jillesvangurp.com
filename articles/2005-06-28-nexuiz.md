 A new open source game based on a heavily modified quake I engine was recently released: nexuiz. And I'm hooked. Nexuiz is a down to earth deatmatch shooter. The whole point is to shoot everything that moves. And that is great fun. It reminds me of the times I played quake II a lot. This game is very much like quake II. Sure the graphics suck but blowing anonymous noobs to pieces with the rocket launcher is just so much fun.
