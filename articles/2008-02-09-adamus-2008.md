One of my colleagues, [Cristiano di Flora](http://research.nokia.com/people/cristiano_di_flora/index.html) with whom I've written several articles over the past year, is co-organizing the [second workshop on Adaptive and DependAble Mobile Ubiquitous Systems](http://www.adamus.ua.ac.be/) (Adamus) that will be co-hosted with this years WoWMoM symposium in California this summer. 

He asked me to do a bit of promotion on my blog, mainly for the purpose of being able to link to a real blog post. So here it goes. The workshop looks like it could be very interesting and well aligned with what Cristiano and I are working on in the Smart Space Lab. So likely we will be presenting there as well. If you are interested in learning more about preliminary results from our current work, check out recent publications on [publications.jillesvangurp.com](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/publications.html).
