This morning I had some more fun marking locations in Google Earth. I documented more holidays. Then I managed to lose all my additions by crashing google earth. It reset to the version I saved last evening. It turns out, it doesn't actually save anything until you exit properly. :-(.
Next time, I'll be saving and exporting a lot more often. Luckily I did some exporting just before it crashed. The exported file imported perfectly. But I came very close to losing a few hours of work. :-).
Anyway, I now have <a href="http://www.jillesvangurp.com/places/Vacations.html">placemarks </a>for all my summer holidays since 1998. The turkey and sweden vacations already have a lot of text on my photo site, so I did not bother to write much text. Both greece vacations will get some more attention later on.

Update 07-12-2006: Google introduced a feature that allows you to display kmz's on Google Maps. This has now been integrated into the xsl so you can now view the kmz in Google Earth or Google Maps. Also I created a nice zip file distribution with some documentation (download <a href="http://www.jillesvangurp.com/places/kml2html.zip">here</a>).
