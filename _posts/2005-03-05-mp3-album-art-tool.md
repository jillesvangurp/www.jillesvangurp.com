 I have a well organized mp3 collection and stumbled upon MP3 Album Art Tool (http://str8dog.com/default.aspx), a tool for automatically retrieving album cover art for each album you have. Together with this winamp plugin: http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=138565, you get nice cover art while listening to your music. 

Of course in practice it doesn't find everything but I consider a 60% score on my collection quite excellent since it includes a lot of stuff that is pretty hard to find anyway. The tool saves a nice folder.jpg in each album folder which means that windows explorer can be tricked into using the album art as a folder icon ![:-)](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/pivot/includes/emot/e_01.gif :-)).
