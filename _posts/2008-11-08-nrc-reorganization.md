My employer, Nokia, announced this week that it is reorganizing Nokia Research Center. The why and how of this operation is explained in the [press release](http://research.nokia.com/news/Nokia+continues+its+change+and+renews+some+of+its+activities).

I learned this on Tuesday along with all my colleagues and have since been finding out how this will affect me. I can of course not comment on any organizational details but it is very likely that I start 2009 in a new job somewhere within Nokia since it looks like the research topic that I have been working on for the past two years is out of scope of the new Helsinki Lab research mission. While I'm of course unhappy about how that decision affects me, I accept and respect it. Short term, I am confident that I will be allowed to finish ongoing research activity since it has been so far highly successful within Nokia and we are quite close to going public with the trial of the [system I demoed on Youtube](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/2008/10/09/local-interaction-demo-on-youtube/) a few weeks ago. I'm very motivated to do this because I've put a lot of time in it and want to see it succeed and get a lot of nice press attention.

However, a topic that is of course on my mind is what I will be doing after that and where I will be doing it. In short, I'm currently looking at several very interesting open positions in Nokia. Since I'm doing that anyway, I've decided to broaden my search and look at all available options, including those outside Nokia. I will pick the best offer I get. Don't get me wrong, I think Nokia is a great employer and I am aware my skills are in strong demand inside Nokia. So, if Nokia makes me a good offer, I will likely accept it. But of course, the world is bigger than Finland where I have now spent three years and I am in no way geographically constrained (i.e. willing to move internationally).

So, I've updated [my CV](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/cv) and am available to discuss any suitable offer.

Since this has happened in the past: please don't contact me about Symbian programming or J2ME programming type jobs. Not interested in either, I'm a server guy.
