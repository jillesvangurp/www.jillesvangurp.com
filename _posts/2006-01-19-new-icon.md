I use this nice browser extension called [forecastfox](http://forecastfox.mozdev.org/) that notifies you of the weather outside. Today it came up with an icon I had never seen before and that people in most parts of the world will never see. It's really cold outside (-22) and forecastfox has an icon for that :-).
