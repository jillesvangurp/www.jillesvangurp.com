Together with my two colleagues [Christian Prehofer](http://www.prehofer.de) and [Cristiano di Flora](http://research.nokia.com/people/cristiano_di_flora/index.html), I wrote a nice workshop paper for the upcoming [Second Workshop on Requirements and Solutions for Pervasive Software Infrastructures (RSPSI)](http://www.igd.fhg.de/igd-a1/RSPSI2/), at UBICOMB 2007, Innsbruck, 16-19 Sebtember, 2007. 

[Towards the Web as a Platform for Ubiquitous Applications in Smart Spaces](http://publications.jillesvangurp.com/WebSmartSpaces.pdf) (pdf).

Abstract:

> We introduce our web based middleware for smart spaces, which strongly relies on technologies used in Internet services. Following the key requirements and
> technologies, we present our architecture for ubiquitous applications in smart spaces. It exploits and leverages many of the key web-technologies as well as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Web 2.0Ã¢â‚¬Â collaborative and social Internet services, including browsers, web servers, development tools and content management systems. In this way, we aim to make many of the highly disruptive ubiquitous applications less disruptive from a technology point of view. Furthermore, we discuss a number of new challenges for applying these technologies in ubiquitous applications. These include the areas of discovery/delivery of services, security, content management, and networking.

The article is a nice milestone in our very your research group. An earlier position paper already outlined our [vision for software development in smart spaces](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/2007/03/21/towards-effective-smart-space-application-development-impediments-and-research-challenges/). This article builds on that vision and makes public a few details of the software we are building in the research group.
