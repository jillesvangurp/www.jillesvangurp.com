I'm not much into life logging, I prefer to stick to technology :-). But under the circumstances, I'll make an exception.

As you may know, I recently got a job as a research engineer at the Nokia Research Center in Helsinki. That means I am going to leave Nijmegen and the Netherlands soon. Soon as in next week. It's been a bit more than five years since I moved back to NL from Sweden and now I'll move to Finland. Just like the previous time indefinately, meaning that I'll move back when I feel like moving back again.

I had my last day at GX last wednesday. Currently I am packing some stuff and tonight there will be drinks at Maxim (a cafe in Nijmegen) for my friends and colleagues. Tomorrow, after the hangover becomes tolerable, I'll visit my parents in Breda and say hello to my sister. Then Monday the moving  people will pack &amp; pick up my stuff and hopefully deliver it to the apartment I will hopefully find real soon after I get to Helsinki, which is on Tuesday.

On a side note, ever since I got the strange idea of moving to Finland I've frequently been humming/whistling/etc. the Finland song: 

```

Finland, Finland, Finland,
The country where I want to be,
Pony trekking or camping,
Or just watching TV.
Finland, Finland, Finland.
It's the country for me.

You're so near to Russia,
So far from Japan,
Quite a long way from Cairo,
Lots of miles from Vietnam.

Finland, Finland, Finland,
The country where I want to be,
Eating breakfast or dinner,
Or snack lunch in the hall.
Finland, Finland, Finland.
Finland has it all.

You're so sadly neglected
And often ignored,
A poor second to Belgium,
When going abroad.

Finland, Finland, Finland,
The country where I quite want to be,
Your mountains so lofty,
Your treetops so tall.
Finland, Finland, Finland.
Finland has it all.

All together, Finland fans!
Finland, Finland, Finland,
The country where I quite want to be,
Your mountains so lofty,
Your treetops so tall.
Finland, Finland, Finland.
Finland has it all.

Finland has it all.

```

 (Monthy Python). Great song.

For those I won't see anymore: it was nice knowing you and maybe we'll meet again.
