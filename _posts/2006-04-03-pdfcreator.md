Finally a nice, free way to generate pdf documents: [PDFCreator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/). For quite some time now I've been doing essentially the same as this plugin does using a combination of tools ([redmon](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/) and [ghostscript](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/)) and printerdrivers (anything that outputs postscript). This tool is much easier to set up than that set of tools. The results should be about the same.
