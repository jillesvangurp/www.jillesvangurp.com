Finally a nice, free way to generate pdf documents: <a title="PDFCreator" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/">PDFCreator</a>. For quite some time now I've been doing essentially the same as this plugin does using a combination of tools (<a title="Redmon" href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/">redmon</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">ghostscript</a>) and printerdrivers (anything that outputs postscript). This tool is much easier to set up than that set of tools. The results should be about the same.
