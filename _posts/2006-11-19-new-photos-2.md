My sister was here last weekend so we did the usual sightseeing and I shot <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-13%20Autumn%20and%20Aukje/index.html">some photos</a>. Of course I visited suomenlinna again so there will be some photos similar to those of last winter.
The weekend before my sister was here, was really cold and I took some nice pictures in a nearby park. The first two (<a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-13%20Autumn%20and%20Aukje/composed.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-13%20Autumn%20and%20Aukje/composed2.jpg">here</a>) have created out of stitched together photos using autopano and hugin to create really detailed close ups that would be difficult to do with a regular lens. I was in fact quite close to the sculpture and shot several photos of different portions of the picture using a focal length that does not distort the perspective too much. To get the full picture using the same focal length would have required me to be much farther away (like <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006-13%20Autumn%20and%20Aukje/IMG_1219.jpg">here</a>, less detail) or to use a really wide angle focal length (beyond the capability of my camera) which would have made the perspective really weird. The effect emphasizes the fact that this is a huge sculpture that is almost as tall as the surrounding trees.
