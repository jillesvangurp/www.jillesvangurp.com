A few months ago I posted a set of placemarks with all the places where I ever lived marked in Google Earth. Last week, Google updated the imagery for the entire Netherlands so I had to revisit those places and found that in a few cases some adjustments were needed. Most of the places are now clearly recognizable and in most cases I tried to position the placemarks roughly where my bed would have been (as far as I can remember): <a title="Places where I used to live" id="p180" href="http://blog.jillesvangurp.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/places-where-i-lived.kmz">Places where I used to live</a>
