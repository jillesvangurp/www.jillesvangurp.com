[JQWeb](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/nerdstuff/jqweb/index.html) is a software package for creating and running webquestionaires. You can create questionaires with JQWebEdit, save them as an XML file. The XML file can then be read by the JQWebServlet which produces an HTML form. The response of the form is processed by another servlet which simply appends it to a textfile. This textfile can than be read by JQWebEdit for analysis. Currently the only analysis supported is converting to tab separated format for easy importing in spreadsheet programs but more complex analysis strategies are on my to-do list. JQWeb is available under LGPL so you can change it as much as you like. And change you should because I never bothered to finish the program.
