I just got back from vacation. The past two weeks I've been visiting Barcelona, my parents in France, Girona, Figueres, Lleida and Zaragoza. Despite having a car for only eight days, I still managed to drive 1650km. I updated my placemarks in Google Earth and regenerated my <a href="http://www.jillesvangurp.com/places/Vacations.html">places website</a> where you can find a complete overview of this trip.

I'll add some photos later on. I filled a 1GB memory card so, processing them properly is going to take some time.
