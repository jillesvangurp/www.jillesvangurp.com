Wow another busy month without me posting. So, here's what will probably be the last post of this year.

In the past few weeks we rolled out OVI Prime Places, http:/www.primeplace.ovi.com, which people may use to register their businesses on OVI maps. Check out the demo video here (click the arrows thingy for full screen).

(video deleted, no longer there; sorry :-))

Anyway, busy few weeks fixing bugs, getting the release out and using the ops induced bureaucracy & downtime for some major refactoring for the next release. All more or less done now and quite ready for a vacation.

Happy Holidays & 2010.
