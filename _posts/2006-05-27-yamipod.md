I just tried out [yamipod](http://www.yamipod.com). I managed to make it crash in less than 20 seconds (launch it, click help menu, crash!). This is the second time I tried it out and the second time it crashes on me before I even get around to doing anything with it. I won't try it a third time.
In short, poorly written app: don't put any valuable data under its control, including music.
