I've been taking photos with my new Canon S80. However, editing (correcting color balance and curves mainly) all that is quite a bit of work.  I finally found some time this morning and three new directories have been added to [photos.jillesvangurp.com](https://www.jillesvangurp.com)
Check [here ](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006%20IV%20April%20Helsinki/index.html)for some April pictures of Helsinki. [Here ](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006%20V%20Eastern/index.html)for a few family snaps from my Eastern holiday and [here ](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006%20VI%20Tallinn/index.html)for my visit to Talling late April. Notice that in the same month we went from frozen harbor to enjoyable spring weather in Tallinn. Basically, spring lasts about two weeks here.

Paticularly the Tallinn photos are very nice. The weather was a bit grey at first but turned quite nice at the end of the afternoon.
