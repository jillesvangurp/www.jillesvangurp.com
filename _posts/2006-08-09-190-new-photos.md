I finally finished editing the many photos from my holiday. I've dropped about one third of the pictures and polished the 190 remaining photos. This was a lot of work obviously but much less (per photo) than last year when I still had to struggle with the powershot A40 which required extensive fiddling with color balance and curves to get somewhat good results. As mentioned before my new Canon S80 is really good. Basically all I did was use auto levels to maximize per channel contrast; boost the contrast slightly using the curves tool and finally, if necessary, crop the image. In a few cases I had to employ some more tricks due to poor exposure and clipping caused by bright sunlight.

Here are some of my favourites, go see the rest <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2006/2006%20VII%20France%20and%20Italy/index.html">here</a> or <a href="http://mopho.jillesvangurp.com/2006/2006%20VII%20France%20and%20Italy/index.html">here </a>on my new mobile site.
