If you've read my past [reviews](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/tag/x-plane/) of [X-plane](http://x-plane.com/), you'll know that I'm somewhat of a fan of that product. It's an ultra realistic flight simulator. If you'll read the product page you will see that it boasts a long list of features. I can assure you, they're being modest. I don't pay for software very often but I've bought [v8](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/2006/03/10/x-plane-832/) and recently [v9](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/2008/06/08/x-plane-9-review/) of this one.

Anyway, I just had a little WTF moment reading this little [blog post](http://xplanescenery.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-cant-talk-now-im-flying-plane.html) from Benjamin Supnik, one of the lead developers of X-plane who works on the scenery engine. They've actually ported X-plane to the iPhone! If so far, you didn't think much of the iPhone as a development platform, look again. This is really impressive.

I just looked up the product page in iTunes and it has some nice screen shots. Of course they don't ship the full UI or scenery. All you get is an area around Inssbruck (default area in the demo version of the normal version). Probably it is heavily tuned to work nicely on an iphone. However, the mere fact that they have it running at all is very impressive. Unfortunately, it's not possible to link to product pages in iTunes, so you'll just have to look it up yourself, producer is Laminar or you can go to Games-&gt;Simulation in the iphone section.

Also hilareous is Austin Meyer (founder and owner of Laminar that builds X-Plane) [denying there was an iphone version of x-plane](http://www.flightsimx.co.uk/xplane/no-iphone-x-plane-yet/), just before he launched it on September 11th. A bit of a symbolic date for launching a flight simulator, don't you think?

Sadly, I have no iPhone or ipod touch to play with. Working for Nokia and all that.
