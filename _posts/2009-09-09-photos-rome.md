I've been polishing my photos in Picasa and ended up using the nice sync feature to upload them to the corresponding photo sharing site as well. So [go here to enjoy them](http://picasaweb.google.com/jillesvangurp/StQuentinLaPoterieRomeAndMarseille?feat=directlink).

Picasa is a bit of a downgrade since I used to spend way too much time polishing with powerful tools such as Photoshop, Gimp, etc. However, I find I like the workflow in Picasa better. And while the few basic edits you can do there leave something to be desired, it's good enough. I have the Gimp installed as well but it's just so slow, buggy and weird to work with it's offensive and I won't be investing in Photoshop on my new mac since the price is just way too high. Technically I could go for Photoshop elements except it doesn't come with some features that I really would want (24 & 32 bit images, LAB mode, layers & ways to combine them, flexible masking, etc). You can sort of do some of that in the Gimp but it is frankly painful and the results tend to be underwhelming. I have some hopes that this KOffice photo thingy might live up to some of the hype. I'll be giving it a try as soon as I can lay my hands on some Mac OS X binaries. Otherwise, if anyone knows of any other OSS photography tools for Mac I'd be very interested. I'm already a Hugin user as blogged earlier this week (and see above linked album for some nice panoramas).
