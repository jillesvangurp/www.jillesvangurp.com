I bought myself a nice [porsche](http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10767) :-). The 1/2 TB type.

Currently the ntfs drive is formatting. I seems to be really quiet, compared to my maxtor external drive or my internal drive. Altogether I now have 1.1 TB of storage available. Should keep me happy for a while.
