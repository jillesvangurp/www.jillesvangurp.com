Well, [this](http://performancing.com/firefox) seems to work. The performancing firefox extension adds a nice blog post editor to firefox. I've just installed it, using this excellent [howto ](http://performancing.com/node/580)for dummies, and I'm now testing if it works. If this post ever appears on my blog, it probably worked :-).
