Well, <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">this</a> seems to work. The performancing firefox extension adds a nice blog post editor to firefox. I've just installed it, using this excellent <a href="http://performancing.com/node/580">howto </a>for dummies, and I'm now testing if it works. If this post ever appears on my blog, it probably worked :-).
