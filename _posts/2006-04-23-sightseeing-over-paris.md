I've written quite a bit on x-plane lately. That was before I discovered a few good quality scenery packages. One of these packages is a 400 MB version of Paris, the capital of France. Wow. You can <a href="http://baugras.club.fr/xplane/index.html">download it here</a>, for free!
Here's some screenshots (all running beautifully smooth). This is by far the most realistic and detailed scenery I've seen for any area in any flightsimulator. X-plane shows off it's exceptional capabilities. Notice the detail in the background? All part of the scenery. This is typically where you'd see a mess of blinking pixels in ms flight simulator. It simply can't handle that amount of detail. In x-plane all the screens below were with my default x-plane settings: render on graphics card, everything set to high except for roads and objects (default, see my earlier discussions), 4x anti aliasing. Framerate was excellent most of the time. I hit some bottlenecks while panning the view, otherwise everything stayed smooth and responsive.

Btw. this is a x-plane v7 scenery, not a v8 scenery.  This means it is lacking some of the new features. Outside paris everything is the nice and default v8 scenery coming with x-plane.
