Seven years ago, I joined Nokia Research Center in Helsinki, Finland to pick up my research career again after a few years of working as a software engineer. Since then, I've been working on many different things but all somehow related to location-based services. Three and a half years ago I moved to Berlin to continue in what has recently been re-labeled as Nokia's Location &amp; Commerce unit where I continued to work on location-based services but this time in a more technical role. I've had loads of fun building some of the core server components in Nokia's places and search products; I've had the pleasure to work with a lot of very smart and talented people with a lot of different backgrounds; and I got to work with all sorts of interesting technologies and server-side infrastructure.

The last seven years were fun, very intense, and I learned a lot. I joined Nokia at the peak of its success. And while I have witnessed the steady erosion of market share and related changes over the past few years, I consider myself lucky to have been in Berlin where despite the relentless re-organizations and re-structurings elsewhere in Nokia, things have stayed positive and optimistic. Today's Location &amp; Commerce unit is in a great shape for the future and has some really solid and exciting products and services. I am genuinely proud to have been a part of that.

But now the time has come for me to move on and seek new challenges and I will leave Nokia at the end of November. I'll still be in Berlin, which has a very lively and interesting start-up scene, and I will be looking there and in other places for new exciting things for me to work on next.
