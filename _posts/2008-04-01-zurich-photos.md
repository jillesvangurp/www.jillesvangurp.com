Last week I was in Zurich and I took some photos, [which have now been added to my photo album](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/02%20Zurich%20IOT2008/index.html). Most of them were taken in the evening. Some of them are pretty nice considering I had no tripod and it was quite dark.

For example this one was taken from a bridge in Zurich with the shutter open for 1.3 seconds. Despite this, it turned out quite OK. I did quite a bit of color correction and curves tweaking on this picture and it turned out quite a bit more brighter than I remember it to be or the original below.
