Last month a European funded research project I'm in kicked off: SENSEI. The official project website is still under construction but somebody was kind enough to [blog about it](http://www.wsnblog.com/2008/02/11/sensei-integrating-the-physical-with-the-digital-world-of-the-network-of-the-future/#more-496) at least. 

Sensei will be a lot of work and hopefully also very interesting and fun. It's a so-called integrated project in FP7 which means it is one of the many projects with a lot of partners (21 in our case) across Europe of both academic and industrial side that are financed by the EU in the context of the [seventh framework programme](http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html) that will distribute billions of research money over the next few years. So if you are an EU citizen, thanks very much for making this possible with your tax money ;-).

Nokia is in Sensei for 9 person years spread over three years (50% funded). The blog post mentioned above has a pretty good overview of the key points of Sensei so I won't repeat them here. My personal interest in this project will be on the software middleware layer.
