Thank you <strike>Santa</strike> Rick Ross! I found this in my mailbox and have already received my gift certificate. Nice gift of the <a href="http://www.javalobby.org">javalobby</a>. Aparently I spend way too much time on that site :-). I have been a member since 1997(?) and leave comments in the forum on a regular basis.<br /><blockquote>Dear Jilles,<br /><br />Thank you so much for being one of Javalobby's top contributors and helping<br />to make Javalobby a great Java developer resource.  We know you have a busy<br />schedule, so we really appreciate that you deliberately make time available<br />to participate and build the community. With your help 2005 was a year of<br />solid growth and positive change, and we hope you will enjoy the<br />enhancements we have planned for 2006.<br /><br />We have a $50 Amazon gift certificate waiting for you as a small token of<br />our appreciation. We'd have sent the code directly in this email, but we<br />couldn't be 100% sure you would receive it at this address. Just send a<br />quick reply to this note, and we'll send your code out. Buy yourself<br />something fun and frivolous, something you wouldn't ordinarily decide to<br />purchase. You do a lot to help Javalobby, and we are genuinely grateful.<br />Thanks again for being one of Javalobby's most valuable contributors.<br /><br />Have a happy, healthy and prosperous 2006!<br /><br />Warmest regards,<br /><span class="sg">Rick Ross</span></blockquote>
