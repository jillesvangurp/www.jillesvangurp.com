Thank you <strike>Santa</strike> Rick Ross! I found this in my mailbox and have already received my gift certificate. Nice gift of the <a href="http://www.javalobby.org">javalobby</a>. Aparently I spend way too much time on that site :-). I have been a member since 1997(?) and leave comments in the forum on a regular basis.<blockquote>Dear Jilles,Thank you so much for being one of Javalobby's top contributors and helpingto make Javalobby a great Java developer resource.  We know you have a busyschedule, so we really appreciate that you deliberately make time availableto participate and build the community. With your help 2005 was a year ofsolid growth and positive change, and we hope you will enjoy theenhancements we have planned for 2006.We have a $50 Amazon gift certificate waiting for you as a small token ofour appreciation. We'd have sent the code directly in this email, but wecouldn't be 100% sure you would receive it at this address. Just send aquick reply to this note, and we'll send your code out. Buy yourselfsomething fun and frivolous, something you wouldn't ordinarily decide topurchase. You do a lot to help Javalobby, and we are genuinely grateful.Thanks again for being one of Javalobby's most valuable contributors.Have a happy, healthy and prosperous 2006!Warmest regards,<span class="sg">Rick Ross</span></blockquote>
