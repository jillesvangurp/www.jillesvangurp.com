If you are a regular, you may have noticed that I switched theme. I was using the excellent fusion theme that I found on [this](http://digitalnature.ro/) site, which like the theme seems to be no longer maintained. So when I upgraded to wordpress 3.2 this morning, I noticed there is a new default theme in there that I kind of like.

The best feature is support for multiple header photos. So I've cropped and uploaded a few photos from my collection and the site will now randomly pick one of the photos listed below. So simple, but so nice to have. Otherwise the theme is pretty basic, which I think is appropriate for a blog. Also it does microformats (which was a major annoyance with the old theme). Finally, it just looks nice and it is likely to be maintained for a while (with it shipping with wordpress and all).
