I've uploaded the <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/07%20Vacation%20in%20Spain/index.html">photos from my recent vacation in Spain</a>. Earlier, I posted an <a href="http://www.jillesvangurp.com/2008/07/29/back-from-vacation-2/">overview of the places</a> I've visited so I won't repeat that here. I took quite a bit of photos and filled both 1GB SD cards I have.

Of course, I took lots of nice panorama photos as well. The latter have also been added to my special <a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Stitched/">stitched photo album</a> where you can admire them in slightly higher resolution. Too bad I don't have the bandwidth + space to put them up in full resolution. For example the one below is originally 18319x2191 pixels wide and composed of no less than 11 8 megapixel photos and the jpeg is 40 MB. The level of detail is amazing. Wordpress is sadly messing up the aspect ratio but if you click on it you should see it properly.
