I submitted a nice position paper with two of my colleagues at Nokia to the CMPPC'07 (Common Models and Patterns for Pervasive Computing) Workshop, at Pervasive 2007 in Toronto next month.

Abstract:<blockquote>State-of-the-art research and existing commercial off-the-shelf solutions provide several technologies and methods for building Smart spaces. However, developing applications on top of such systems is quite a complex task due to several impediments and limitations of available solutions. This paper provides an overview of such impediments and outlines what are the main research challenges that still need to be solved in order to enable effective development of applications and systems that fully exploit the capabilities of state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies. The paper also outlines a few specific issues and impediments that we, at the Nokia Research Center, faced in this field so far. It also sheds some light on how we are going to tackle some of the mentioned issues in the future.</blockquote>
