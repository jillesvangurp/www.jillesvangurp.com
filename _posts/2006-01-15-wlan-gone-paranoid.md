My new PC has a smc wlan pci card. It seems to work very nicely with none of the <a href="http://blog.jillesvangurp.com/?p=83">problems </a>my previous siemens usb stick had. However, I appear to be not connected, currently. Which is strange since I seem to have no problem browsing the web, downloading stuff, etc. But the windows wireless icon insists on displaying a red cross (usually that means trouble). Weird. If Idouble click it, it will confirm that it isn't connected, along with a text "you are connected to this network" below the text "not connected". It also displays four out of five green bars which tell me the (dis)connection is excellent.  Ah well, it's only service pack 2.
