One of the .coms that survived (and ridiculed) the whole .com thing is [despair.com](http://www.despair.com/). For years now their calendars have been a yearly treat.  Hilarious, month by month (the individual months are put online, at unprintable but readable size). I've been regularly checking their site since around 1999. And now they have a [vidcast](http://outcasts.despair.com/itunes2). It looks like a regular business video but the content is pure satire. Be sure to check out every corner of that site.
