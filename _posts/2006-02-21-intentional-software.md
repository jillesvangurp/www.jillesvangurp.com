From a very [interesting article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html) by Martin Fowler:

I've had the opportunity to spend a little time with Intentional Software  and several of my colleagues at ThoughtWorks have worked closely with Intentional over the last year or so. As a result I've had the opportunity to peek behind the Intentional curtain - although I'm restricted in how much I can say about what I saw there. Fortunately they intend to start opening up about their work over the next year or so.

Whoohoo! I've been following the developments around this company for a few years now. Charles Simonyi is mostly known for being one of the influential architects at Microsoft responsible for creating and popularizing such things as WYSIWYG editing, Excell and the [Hungarian notation](http://ootips.org/hungarian-notation.html). Simply put, the guy is brilliant. A brilliant guy with a vision: intentional programming/software. Working for Microsoft from the beginning, he is one of their richer Microsoft millionnaires/billionaires (tm). A few years ago he quit his job at Microsoft to start his own company called [Intentional Software](http://intentsoft.com/). Before that he published a few articles on intentional programming which, frankly, include some ideas that are way beyond the imagination of the average C/C++/Java/C#/whatever programmer. While these guys fight over such petty things as syntax, he made it a first class entity in his programming environment. Intentional programming is all about translating intentions to working code. If doing C++ style templates is your intention, define them in the core constructs provided by the intentional programming environment and write them.

But what am I doing, trying to summarize Martin Fowler's excellent article into one paragraph. Go read his [article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html). It will take you some time but it will be time well spent.

I've been a long time fan of Martin Fowler. I should check his [site ](http://martinfowler.com/)more often.
