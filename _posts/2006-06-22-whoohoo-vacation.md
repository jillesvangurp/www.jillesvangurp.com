After working pretty much non stop since December, I now have three whole weeks of vacation. Tomorrow I'll fly to Marseille (fr) and drive to my parents new summer home in Saint Quentin La Poterie (about 50km from Avignon). After spending about a week there I'll drive into Italy to do my usual style of vacation: drive insane amounts of distances and see lots of stuff. Anyway, I should be back online in a couple of weeks.
