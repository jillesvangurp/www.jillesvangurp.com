Ok, I'm considering to buy a RAID 5 external drive. If you have no clue what I mean by that, stop reading. Anyway, one of the products that seems interesting is the Lacie S1S 2TB which is a nice setup that includes four hot swappable 500GB drives.
<div align="left">Now here's the catch (straight from the manual):</div>
<blockquote>
<div align="left">Caution! Do NOT attempt to replace a hard disk yourself. Removing a hard disk from a Drive Bay will void the
warranty.</div>
</blockquote>
Eh, excuse me? The whole point of buying a raid 5 setup is being able to fix a disk failure by replacing it with a new one without powering down the unit (which according to another quote in the same manual is an extremely bad idea in the event of disk failure). So I guess no Lacie for me (hey that rimes!).

Actually I'm looking for a simple setup that:
<ul>
	<li>uses little power (It's going to be inactive pretty much most of the time).</li>
	<li>makes no/little noise (it's going to be in my living room)</li>
	<li>comes without drives (so I can install some myself)</li>
	<li>is easy to maintain, particularly in the eventuality of drive failure</li>
	<li>is easy to connect (USB 2 or gigabit ethernet).</li>
	<li>allows for at least four drives (more is better)</li>
	<li>supports raid 5 (I want my data to survive failure of 1 disk)</li>
	<li>is reliable as hell (I several drives currently and am terrified of the day they will fail)</li>
</ul>
Tips are welcome. Right now I am seriously interested in the <a href="http://www.synology.com/enu/products/CS406series/index.php">Synology CS-406</a>, which gets a really good review at <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/2006/09/15/synology_cs406_cube_station_nas/">Tom's hardware</a>. The price is reasonable and it seems to meet all the listed criteria above and it comes with a whole bunch of very cool additional features.
