i am trying out the mini opera browser right now. as in posting this from my nokia 9300. excuses for the la.k of capitals, pressing shift an another key is a bit difficult on this keyboard. anyway, opera mini is the first usable, mobile browser i have encountered. It consists of a server that optizes the page for mobile viewing and a midp browser that displays it.
