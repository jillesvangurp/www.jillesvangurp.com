It seems the captcha plugin (<a href="http://fuctweb.com/2007/06/15/capcc/">capcc</a>) I was using with wordpress has been broken for some time. Probably this happened when I installed wp 2.5 a few weeks ago. My friend Christian del Rosso pointed this out. I installed a different plugin now (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yacaptcha/#post-2915">yacaptcha</a>) which both looks nicer and hopefully works better too.

So if you couldn't comment because of this, try again.
