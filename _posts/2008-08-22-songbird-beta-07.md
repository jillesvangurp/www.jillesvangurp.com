[Songbird Blog Ã‚Â» Songbird Beta is Released!](http://blog.songbirdnest.com/2008/08/20/songbird-beta-is-released/).

Having played with several milestone builds of songbird, I was keen to try this one. This is a big milestone for this music player &amp; browser hybrid. Since I've blogged on this before, I will keep it short.

The good:
<ul>
	<li>New feathers (songbird lingo for UI theme) looks great. Only criticism is that it seems to be a bit of an iTunes rip off.</li>
	<li>Album art has landed</li>
	<li>Stability and memory usage is now acceptable for actually using the application</li>
	<li>Unlike iTunes, it actually supports the media buttons on my logitech keyboard.</li>
</ul>
The bad (or not so good since I have no big gripes):
<ul>
	<li>Still no support for the iTunes invented but highly useful compilation flag (<a href="http://bugzilla.songbirdnest.com/show_bug.cgi?id=9090">bug 9090</a>). This means that my well organized library is now filled with all sorts of obscure artists that I barely know but apparently have one or two songs from. iTunes sorts these into compilation corner and I use this feature to keep a nice overview of artists and complete albums.</li>
	<li>Despite being a media player with extension support, there appears to be no features related to sound quality. Not even an equalizer. Not even as an extension. This is a bit puzzling because this used to be a key strength of winamp, the AOL product that the songbird founders used to be involved with.</li>
	<li>Despite being a browser, common browser features are missing. So no bookmarks, no apparent RSS feed, no Google preconfigured in the search bar, etc. Some of these things are easily fixed with extensions.</li>
</ul>
Verdict: much closer than previous builds but still no cigar. Key issue for me is compilation flag support. Also I'd really like to see some options for affecting audio playback quality. I can see how having a browser in my media player could be useful but this is not a good browser nor a good media player yet.
