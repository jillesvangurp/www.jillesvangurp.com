I stumbled on two interesting programs that effectively turn my webcam into a head tracking device. The first one is a reasonably priced commercial package called <a href="http://www.cachya.com/esight/overview.php">Cachya</a>. They have a trial version available that I installed to play with. The second one is a french open source product <a href="http://freetrack.online.fr/english/">freetrack</a>.

Why is this interesting?

(freetrack with a race game)

So, basically this stuff allows you to look around while flying around in your flight simulator. Since I spend quite some time in <a href="http://x-plane.com">x-plane</a> that is highly interesting.

Of course I installed both packages. 

Freetrack is free but has one disadvantage: you need to attach a bunch of leds to your head for it to work. Since I don't have any, am not planning a career as a Christmas tree and since the documentation is in French, I didn't get very far with it. But it's free and definitely tempting to give another try.

I also tried Cachya. It seems quite nice and doesn't require any leds. Instead it works with a symbol that you can print out and attach to your cap. You will still look silly of course but not so bad as with a bunch of leds attached to your head. And considering the above videos, I might end up buying it. The only problem is that the trial version so far is not very convincing. A problem is that I have some nasty backlight from the window which tends to confuse it. Also I had lots of issues controlling the demo with my head. So altogether, I'm not quite ready to get my wallet out yet.

Then of course the expensive option is <a href="http://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/">track-ir</a>. This one apparently works but it is quite expensive and you still end up attaching reflectors to your head and connecting a bulky tracking device to your PC.
