![Selfportrait to show off new glasses](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/images/selfportrait.jpg)
I'm not in the habit of making self portraits. Doing so is a quite hard and somehow vaguely embarrassing. I removed my previous attempt from my homepage after repeated warnings from friends and family that the photo was not exactly a masterpiece.

But circumstances forced me to make a new one. You see, I'm getting a bit older now and recently I started noticing my eyes felt really tired after a day of staring at the computer screen which made it hard to do the same in the evenings. So, I had my eyes checked and I now have some glasses with a small prisma and spherical correction which appears to be doing the trick.

Anyway, since I don't see my family every week (I've been livng in Helsinki since November 2005) I got some requests from various people for a photo with my new glasses. So, here it is. I've taken about 20 shots, 19 of those are of the same dubious quality as my previous mugshot.  This one has some focus issues but seems to be the best nevertheless. Of course I can always blame the glasses, hah!

These particular glassses took some time to find. It seems all shops sell more or less the same glasses with an annoying lack of variation in shape. Essentially there are three or four similar shapes which I suppose is due to the fact that it is easier to mass produce lenses if the frames conform to the same standards. This, nearly round style of glasses is quite hard to find. I happen to prefer round glasses.
