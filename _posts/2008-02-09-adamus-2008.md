One of my colleagues, <a href="http://research.nokia.com/people/cristiano_di_flora/index.html">Cristiano di Flora</a> with whom I've written several articles over the past year, is co-organizing the <a href="http://www.adamus.ua.ac.be/">second workshop on Adaptive and DependAble Mobile Ubiquitous Systems</a> (Adamus) that will be co-hosted with this years WoWMoM symposium in California this summer. 

He asked me to do a bit of promotion on my blog, mainly for the purpose of being able to link to a real blog post. So here it goes. The workshop looks like it could be very interesting and well aligned with what Cristiano and I are working on in the Smart Space Lab. So likely we will be presenting there as well.
