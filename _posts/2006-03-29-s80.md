I first began considering buying a new digital camera around 2004. Forever drooling over <a href="http://www.dpreview.com">dpreview </a>and other sites I ultimately decided not to buy the Canon powershot A90, 520, 620, IS, IS2. Reasons varied from "I don't really need one right now", "camera X sure looks nice but lets wait for camera Y" to "my A40 is still pretty nice".After reading the reviews of the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canons80/">Canon S80</a>, I decided this camera was perfect for me. Good quality lense, smaller than my clunky Canon Powershot A40, nice zoom range, wide angle lense, 8 mega pixels (yeah I know, not relevant), etc. This was like three months ago. Since then I've gone to several stores, played with a testmodel at Verkkokauppa several times. Price was essentially right. Then I queued to buy it and waited, waited and left the store. I went back on a Saturday (stupid) and again ended up not buying. Then the camera was sold out (i.e. queued for 10 minutes and then left the store disappointed). Today I checked again, they had it and money was exchanged.Whoohoo!. Currently the battery is charging, after that I'll make a few pictures with it and maybe upload a few.
