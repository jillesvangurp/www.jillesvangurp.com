While updating my photosite I noticed I had accidentally broken it with some .htaccess rule that was redirecting index.html to www.jillesvangurp/index.php. Anyway, problem solved.

I also took the opportunity to upload photos from:

- A trip to [Madrid](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/04%20Sensei%20Meeting%20Madrid/index.html) in April for the EU Sensei project I'm in.
- Another Sensei trip to [Guildford](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/05%20Sensei%20Meeting%20Guildford/index.html) (UK) last week.
- A visit from my friend [Mark](https://www.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2008/06%20Visit%20Mark/index.html) last weekend. We rented a car and did some serious driving to Nuuksio, Hanko (with a stop at Raseborg's castle) and Naantali. Also we celebrated midsummer together with a lot of wet Fins in Seurasari, just behind my house.

Given that I'm traveling to Madrid again next wednesday (vacation), it was about time too.
