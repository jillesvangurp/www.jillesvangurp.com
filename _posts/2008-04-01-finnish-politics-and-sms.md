What is it with Finnish politics and SMS messages? First prime minister Vanhanen <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Off_Beat/0,,2-1225-2107_2038961,00.html">dumps his girlfriend by SMS</a> and now a foreign minister <a href="http://www.yle.fi/news/id86849.html">gets fired</a> over some SMS messages to a stripper.
