I've been using my camera and photoshop a bit the past few months and finally found the time to let jalbum do its job. I've added three directories to my photo album:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2007/2007-02%20-%20Winter/index.html">Some pictures I took on my way to work when it was very cold a few months ago</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2007/2007-04%20-%20Amsterdam/index.html">Playing tourist in Amsterdam</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://photos.jillesvangurp.com/Album/2007/2007-03%20-%20Zurich/index.html">Nice view on the lake and mountains near Zurich</a></li>
</ul>
